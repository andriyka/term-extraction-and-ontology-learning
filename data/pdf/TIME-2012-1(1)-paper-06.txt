 Abstract?There are two natural and well-studied ap-
 proaches to temporal ontology and reasoning, that is, point-
 based and interval-based. Usually, interval-based temporal
 reasoning deals with points as a particular case of duration-less
 intervals. Recently, a two-sorted point-interval temporal logic
 in a modal framework in which time instants (points) and time
 periods (intervals) are considered on a par has been presented.
 We consider here two-sorted first-order languages, interpreted
 in the class of all linear orders, based on the same principle,
 with relations between points, between intervals, and inter-
 sort. First, for those languages containing only interval-interval,
 and only inter-sort relations we give complete classifications
 of their sub-fragments in terms of relative expressive power,
 determining how many, and which, are the different two-sorted
 first-order languages with one or more such relations. Then,
 we consider the full two-sorted first-order logic with all the
 above mentioned relations, restricting ourselves to identify all
 expressively complete fragments and all maximal expressively
 incomplete fragments, and posing the basis for a forthcoming
 complete classification.
 Keywords-First-order logic, definability, interval, point and
 mixed relations.
 I. INTRODUCTION
 The relevance of temporal logics in many theoretical and
 applied areas of computer science and AI, such as theories of
 action and change, natural language analysis and processing,
 and constraint satisfaction problems, is widely recognized.
 While the predominant approach in the studies of temporal
 reasoning and logics has been based on the assumption of
 time points (instants) as the primary temporal ontological
 entities, there have also been active studies of interval-based
 temporal reasoning and logics over the past two decades.
 The variety of binary relations between intervals in linear
 orders (now known as Allen?s relations) was first studied
 systematically by Allen [1], who explored their use in
 systems for time management and planning. Allen?s work,
 and other relevant followups, are based on the assumption
 that time can be represented as a dense line, and points
 are excluded from the semantics. Various modal and first-
 order formalisms for reasoning about Allen?s relations have
 been studied in the literature. At the modal level, Halpern
 and Shoham [2] introduced the multi-modal logic HS that
 comprises modal operators for all possible relations between
 two intervals in a linear order, and it has been followed
 by a series of publications studying expressiveness and de-
 cidability/undecidability and complexity of the fragments of
 HS, e.g., [3], [4], [5]. At the first-order level representation
 theorems have been a major concern: for a given set of
 interval relations, is it possible to write down a set of first-
 order formulas in the corresponding signature which would
 constrain relational structures to be isomorphic to concrete
 one consisting of intervals over a linear order together with
 the appropriate interval relations? Results here include van
 Benthem [6], Allen and Hayes [1], Ladkin [7], Venema [8],
 Goranko, Montanari, and Sciavicco [9], and Coetzee [10].
 Many studies on interval logics have considered the so-called
 ?non-strict? interval semantics, allowing point-intervals (with
 coinciding endpoints) along with proper ones, and thus
 encompassing the instant-based approach, too; see e.g., [2],
 [3], [4]. Yet, little has been done so far on formal treatment
 of both temporal primitives, points and intervals, together
 in a two-sorted framework. A detailed philosophical study
 of both approaches, point-based and interval-based, can be
 found in [6]. A similar mixed approach has been studied
 in [11]. In [12] both sorts are used and the relations
 between them is studied, but this only under the hypothesis
 of denseness. More recently, a modal logic that includes
 different operators for points and interval was presented
 in [13].
 The present paper provides a systematic treatment of point
 and interval relations at the first-order level, with equality
 not necessarily assumed in the language. We study the
 relative expressive power of first-order languages containing
 interval relations. Our work is motivated by, among other
 observations, the fact that natural languages incorporate both
 ontologies on a par, without assuming the primacy of one
 over the other, and have the capacity to shift smoothly the

 perspective from instants to intervals and vice versa within
 the same discourse, and that there are various temporal sce-
 narios which neither of the two ontologies alone can grasp
 properly (that is, when treatment of intervals as sets of their
 internal points, nor the treatment of points as ?instantaneous?
 intervals, is really adequate). In this way, we pose the basis
 for a further study of point-interval temporal modal logics,
 and, on a longer perspective, for a proper definition and
 study of point-interval (first-order and modal) logics over
 non-linear orders. We therefore ask the question: how many
 and which expressively different first-order languages can
 be obtained by varying the combinations of intervals and
 points relations in the signature? Since, as we will see,
 there are 26 different relations (including equality of both
 sorts) between points, intervals, and points and intervals,
 226 is an upper bound to this number1. However, since
 certain relations are definable in terms of other ones, the
 actual number is less and in fact, as we will show, much
 less. The answer will also depend on our choices of certain
 semantic parameters, specifically, the class of linear orders
 over which we construct our interval structures. In this
 paper we consider the classification problem in the class
 of all linear orders. Preliminary work that provides a similar
 classifications, based on intervals only, appeared in [14].
 II. FIRST ORDER LOGIC AND POINT / INTERVAL
 RELATIONS
 Given a linear order D = hD;<i, we call the elements
 of D points (denoted by a; b; : : :) and define an interval
 as an ordered pair [a; b] of points in D, where a < b (and
 endpoints are included in the interval). Abstract intervals will
 be denoted by I; J; : : : ; and so on. There are 12 possible
 relations, excluding equality, between any two intervals,
 which we call interval-interval relations. Besides equality,
 there are 2 different relations that may hold between any
 two points (before and after), called hereafter point-point
 relations, and 5 different relations between a point and
 an interval and vice-versa: we call those interval-point
 1It is worth noticing that in [12] the authors distinguish 30 relations,
 instead of 26; this is due to the fact that the concepts of the point a starting
 the interval [a; b] and meeting it are considered to be different.
 and point-interval relations, respectively, and we use the
 term mixed relations to refer to them indistinctly. Interval-
 interval relations are exactly Allen?s relations [1]; point-
 point relations are the obvious one on a linear order, and
 mixed relations will be explained below. Traditionally in-
 terval relations are represented by the initial letter of the
 description of the relation, like m for meet. However, when
 one considers more relations (like point-point and point-
 interval relations) this notation becomes confusing, and even
 more so in the presence of more relations, e.g. when one
 wants to consider interval relations over a partial order2.
 We introduce the following notation to resolve this issue:
 an interval [a; b] induces a partition of D into five regions
 (see [15]): region 0, which contains all points less than a,
 region 1 which contains a only, region 2 which contains all
 the points strictly between a and b, region 3 which contains
 only b and region 4 which contains the points greater than
 b. Likewise, a point c induces a partition of D into 3 pieces:
 region 0 is all the points less than c, region 2 contains
 only c and region 4 contains all the points greater than
 c. Interval-interval relations will be denoted by Ik k 0iiJ ,
 where k; k0 2 f0; 1; 2; 3; 4g, and k represent the region of
 the partition induced by I in which the the left endpoint
 of J falls, while k0 is the region of the same partition in
 which the right endpoint of J falls; for example, I34iiJ
 is exactly Allen?s relation meets. Similarly, interval-point
 relations will be denoted by Ik ipa, where k represents
 the position of a with respect to I; for example, I4ipa is
 the relation before. Symmetrically, point-point relations will
 be denoted by the symbol k pp, and point-interval relations
 by the symbol k k 0pi. For point-point relations it is more
 convenient to use < instead of 4pp, and > instead of 0pp.
 In Tab. I we show six of the interval-interval relations, and
 in Tab. II we show the interval-point relations. Finally, we
 consider a sorted equality; the symbol =i will denote the
 equality between intervals, and =p, as mentioned above,
 the equality between points, substituting 2pp. Now, given
 any one of the mentioned relations r, its inverse  r can be
 obtained by inverting the roles of the objects in the case
 of non-mixed relations; therefore, for example, the inverse
 of the relation 22ii (Allen?s relation during) is the relation
 04ii (contains). On the other hand, mixed relations present
 a different situation: the inverse of a point-interval relation
 is an interval-point relation; thus, for example, the inverse
 of 3ip is 02pi. Finally, notice that some combinations, such
 as 22pi, makes no sense, and are forbidden.
 We will denote by R the set of all above described
 relations; by I  R the subset of all interval-interval
 relations (Allen?s relations); by M  R the subset of all

 is our intention to complete this study to include the treatment of partial
 orders also, and, at this stage, we want to make sure that we will be able
 to maintain the notation consistent.

 mixed relations; and, finally, by P  R the subset of
 all point-point relations. Clearly, R = I [ M [ P. As
 we work within first-order logic, all inverses of relations
 are explicitly definable; accordingly, let I+ be the set of
 interval-interval relations given in Tab. I together with =i,
 M+ be the set of interval-point relations given in Tab. II,
 and P+ = f<;=pg. Lastly, let R+ = I+ [M+ [ P+.
 Given a subset S = fr1; : : : ; rng  R+, a concrete point-
 interval structure of signature S is a two-sorted relational
 structure F = hD; I(D); r1; r2; : : : ; rni, where D is a linear
 order, I(D) is the set of all intervals in D, and each ri is
 defined on D [ I(D) according to Tab. I and Tab. II. Since
 all relations are already implicit in D [ I(D), we will often
 simply write hD; I(D)i for a concrete point-interval structure
 hD; I(D); r1; r2; : : : ; rni, and we denote by FO(S) the two-
 sorted language of first-order logic (without equality on both
 sorts) with relation symbols corresponding to the relations
 in S; such definitions are readily adaptable to the single-
 sort cases. In the two-sorted context, we will use different
 symbols for variables that are supposed to be interpreted
 over different sorts; in particular, xp; yp; : : : will denote point
 variables, xi; yi; : : : interval variables, and x; y; : : : will be
 used when we do not want to specify the sort.
 Definition 1: Let S  R+ (resp., S  I+). We say that
 FO(S) defines r 2 R (resp., r 2 I) over all linear orders,
 denoted by FO(S) ! r, if there exists FO(S)-formula
 ?(x; y) such that ?(x; y)$ r(x; y) is valid on the class of
 all concrete point-interval structures (resp., concrete interval
 structures) of signature (S [frg) based on any linear order.
 Obviously, FO(S)! r for all r 2 S.
 Definition 2: Let S  R+ (resp., S  I+). We say that
 S is R+-complete over all linear orders (resp. I+-complete
 over all linear orders), if and only if FO(S)! r for all r 2
 R+ (resp., r 2 I+); and, minimally complete over all linear
 orders, denoted by mcs (resp., maximally incomplete over all
 linear orders, denoted by MIS) if and only if it is complete
 (resp., incomplete) over all linear orders, and, every proper
 subset (resp., every strict superset) of S is incomplete (resp.,
 complete) over all linear orders.
 In what follows, in order to prove that FO(S) 6! r

 for some r, we will make use of the notion of strong
 surjective homeomorphism and its properties w.r.t. the sat-
 isfiability preserving of FO-formulas (see, e.g. [16]). A
 strong surjective homomorphism from F = hD; I(D); Si to
 F 0 = hD0; I(D0); Si, where S = fr1; r2; : : : ; rng and D;D0
 are linear orders, is a map  : D [ I(D) ! D0 [ I(D0)
 such that: 1) it respects sorts and is surjective; 2) ri(a; b) iff
 ri( (a);  (b)) for all point-point relations ri 2 S; 3) ri(a; I)
 (resp., ri(I; a)) iff ri( (a);  (I)) (resp., ri( (I);  (a))) for
 all point-interval (resp., interval-point) relations ri 2 S, and
 4) ri(I; J) iff ri( (I);  (J)) for all interval-interval relations
 ri 2 S. If =i and =p are in S then it follows that  will
 be injective, and, thus, an isomorphism. If, also F = F 0
 then  is an automorphism of F . For the sake of clarity we
 will define  as a pair ( i;  p), where  i : I(D)! I(D0) and
  p : D! D0. If  is a strong surjective homomorphism, then
 F and F 0 satisfy the same FO(S) formulas. Thus, to show
 that FO(fr1; r2; : : : ; rng) 6! r it is sufficient to find two
 structures F and F 0 and a strong surjective homomorphism
  : F ! F 0 which breaks r, i.e., such that there are two
 objects of the right type in S related through r and such that
 their images are not.
 III. I+-COMPLETENESS AND INCOMPLETENESS
 We start with the expressive power of relations in I+.
 This has been studied in [14] for different classes of linear
 orders but the difference here is that equality is treated at
 the level of the other relations.
 Theorem 3: [14] The minimal I+-complete and maximal
 I+-incomplete sets over the class of all linear orders are
 those and only those shown in Tab. III.
 Proof: For each minimal complete set S, we prove that
 S can express all interval-interval relations. We first show
 that =i can be expressed in terms of 34ii, by using the
 following definition:
 xi =i yi $ 8zi(zi34iixi $ zi34iiyi) ^
 8zi(xi34iizi $ yi34iizi):
 Referring ourselves to [1] for the remaining definitions in the
 case of 34ii, we can easily prove that 34ii is indeed complete.
 From there, the definability equations in [14] give us the
MIS(M+)s mcs(M+)s

 entire result, with the exception of the case of f14ii; 44iig,
 as equality plays a central role in the definitions. On the
 other hand, =i can be actually defined in terms of 14ii as
 follows:
 xi =i yi $ 8zi(zi14iixi $ zi14iiyi) ^
 8zi(xi14iizi $ yi14iizi);
 and, so, we are done. Incompleteness results are not affected
 by the presence of the equality: the proofs in in [14] use au-
 tomorphisms which apply unchanged in our current setting.
 Finally, minimality of complete sets is proven by observing
 that each proper subset of a complete set is contained in an
 incomplete one, and maximality of the incomplete ones by
 observing that each proper extension of an incomplete set
 contains a complete one.
 Theorem 4: The expressively different fragments of
 FO(I+) are exactly those depicted in Fig. 1.
 Proof: In [14] it was shown that, when equality is
 always assumed in the language, the expressively dif-
 ferent fragments of FO(I+) are exactly those corre-
 sponding to I+, f14ii;=ig, f03ii;=ig, and all subsets
 of f44ii; 04ii; 24ii;=ig which contain =i. In other words,
 the picture looks exactly like the sublattice of the one in
 Fig. 1 above f=ig. To complete the picture, it suffices to
 make the following observations: (1) FO(f14iig) !=i, as
 was shown in the proof of Theorem 3. (2) Symmetrically,
 FO(f03iig)!=i. (3) The fragments f14ii;=ig, f03ii;=ig,
 and f44ii; 04ii; 24ii;=ig are pairwise incomparable in terms
 of expressive power, for assuming that they are not leads to
 a contradiction with the fact that they are incomplete. (4)
 No relation in f44ii; 04ii; 24ii;=ig is definable in terms of
 any set of the others. Indeed to see that none of 44ii, 04ii,
 24ii can be defined in terms of any of the others one can use
 the simple automorphism arguments used for this purpose
 in the proof of Theorem 5 of [14] unchanged. Lastly, to
 see that FO(f44ii; 04ii; 24iig) 6!=i, consider the structures
 F = hI(D); 44ii; 04ii; 24iii with D the order f0 < 1 < 2g,
 and F 0 = hI(D0); 44ii; 04ii; 24iii with D0 the order fa < bg.
 The map  : I(D) ! I(D) which sends every interval in
 I(D) to [a; b] is a strong surjective homomorphism, since
 the relations 44ii, 04ii, 24ii are empty in both structures.
 However,  breaks =i.
 IV. M+-COMPLETENESS AND INCOMPLETENESS
 The situation for relations in M+ over linear orders is
 depicted in Tab. IV; it is worth to observe that that there is
 no equality involved.
 Lemma 5: Each set in the rightmost column of Tab. IV
 is M+-complete over the class of all linear orders.
 Proof: Let us work case-by-case. In the case f1ip; 3ipg
 we exploit the result recalled in Theorem 3 concerning the
 I+-completeness of the interval-interval relation 34ii. First,
 we prove that the latter can be expressed in the fragment
 f1ip; 3ipg:
 xi34iiyi $ 9zp(xi3ipzp ^ yi1ipzp);
 whose correctness is immediate. Then, we can use any
 interval-interval relation to express the remaining interval-
 point relations:
 xi0ipyp $ 9zi(xi03iizi ^ zi1ipyp);
 xi2ipyp $ 9zi(xi24iizi ^ zi1ipyp);
 xi4ipyp $ 9zi(xi14iizi ^ zi3ipyp):
 Again, the correctness of the above is straightforward. In the
 case of f1ip; 2ipg, we first define 0ip, as follows:
 xi0ipyp $ 9zi9wp(zi1ipyp ^ xi1ipwp ^ zi2ipwp):
 Then, we observe that the interval-interval relation 14ii can
 be defined in this fragment:
 xi14iiyi $ 9zp9wp(yi1ipwp ^ xi1ipwp ^
 :(xi2ipzp) ^ yi2ipzp):
 Finally, from the above we easily get 4ip, and then 3ip by
 difference:
 xi4ipyp $ :(xi0ipyp _ xi1ipyp _ xi2ipyp) ^
 9zi(zi14iixi ^ 9wp(:(yi2ipwp) ^ zi2ipwp)):
 Again, it is rather straightforward to prove that the above
 definitions are correct.
 Lemma 6: Each set in the leftmost column of Tab. IV is
 M+-incomplete over the class of all linear orders.
 Proof: As in the previous lemma, we proceed case-by-
 case. Incompleteness of f0ip; 1ipg can be shown as follows.
 Consider the point-interval structure F = hQ; I(Q); 0ip; 1ipi,
 where Q is the set or rational numbers with their usual
 ordering. Define  as a pair of functions  = ( i;  p), where
  i : I(Q) ! I(Q) such that  : [a; b] 7! [a; a + 2  jb  aj];
 and where  p is the identity function on Q. In other words,
 the image of any interval [a; b] under  has the same
 beginning point, but double the length of [a; b]. We claim
 that  is an automorphism of the structure F . It is clear
 that  is a bijection. Further, [a1; b1]0ipc1 if and only if
 c1 < a1, that is, if and only if  ([a; b]) = [a1; a1 + 2

 jb1  a1j]0ipc1 =  (c1), and similarly for 1ip. Now, as
 :[0; 1]2ip1 and  ([0; 1])2ip (1) (i.e., [0; 2]2ip1), we have that
  breaks 2ip, that is, FO(f0ip; 1ipg) 6! 2ip. Finally, in the
 case of f0ip; 2ip; 4ipg, consider the structure F = hD =
 fa < bg; I(D); 0ip; 2ip; 4ipi. Define  = ( i;  p) as a pair
 of functions  i : I(D) ! I(D) such that  ([a; b]) 7! [a; b],
 and  p : D ! D such that  (a) 7! b and  (b) 7! a. We
 claim that  is an automorphism of F . Indeed,  is clearly
 a bijection, and, further the relations 0ip, 2ip, and 4ipg are
 empty and hence respected. It is also clear that  breaks 3ip,
 for example. Indeed [a; b] 3ip b, while it is not the case that
 ( ([a; b])3ip p(b), i.e., that [a; b] 3ip a. Therefore 3ip cannot
 be expressed in this language, and thus the considered set
 must be incomplete.
 Now, Theorem 7 follows from lemmas 5 and 6 together
 with the observation that each proper subset of a minimally
 complete set is contained in an incomplete one and each
 proper extension of an incomplete set contains a complete
 set.
 Theorem 7: The minimal M+-complete and maximal
 M+-incomplete sets over the class of all linear orders are
 those and only those shown in Tab. IV.
 Theorem 8: The lattice of expressively different frag-
 ments of FO(M+) is depicted in Fig. 2.
 Sketch: Given Theorem 7, it only remains to clas-
 sify the subsets of f3ip; 4ipg, f0ip; 1ipg, and f0ip; 2ip; 4ipg.
 Moreover, by their maximal incompleteness, these three
 sets must be incomparable. Let us work case-by case.
 First, consider FO(f3ipg) 6! 4ip. Consider the structure
 F1 = hR; I(R); 3ipi with R the reals with their usual
 ordering, and the automorphism  = ( i;  p) where  i is
 given by  i([a; b]) = [a  1; b  1] if b is rational and
  i([a; b]) = [a + 1; b + 1] otherwise, and  p is given by
  p(a) = a 1 if a is rational and  p(a) = a+ 1 otherwise.
 This breaks 4ip since, e.g., [0;
 p
 2]4ip2 but it is not the
 case that  i([0; 2])4ip p(2), i.e., that it is not the case that
 [1;
 p
 2+1])4ip1. As for the case FO(f4ipg) 6! 3ip, let F2 =
 hD; I(D); 4ipi with D the ordering 0 < 1 < 2. Consider the
 automorphism  = ( i;  p) where  i is the identity on I(D),
 and  p swaps 0 and 1 leaving 2 fixed. This breaks 3ip since
 [0; 1]3ip1 but it is not the case that  i([0; 1])3ip p(1), i.e., it is
 not the case that [0; 1]3ip0. The cases FO(f1ipg) 6! 0ip and
 FO(f0ipg) 6! 1ip are symmetric to the above two cases. The
 case FO(f0ip; 2ipg)! 4ip is dealt with as follows. Consider
 any structure hD; I(D); 0ip; 2ipi. Define R1  I(D) D such
 that xiR1yp iff :(xi0ipyp) ^ :(xi2ipyp). Thus [a; b]R1c iff
 c = a or b  c. Next define R2  I(D) D such that
 xiR2yp $ (xiR1yp) ^ 9wp(xi2ipwp) ^
 9zi9wp(xiR1wp ^ zi0ipwp ^ ziR1yp):
 So [a; b]R2c iff [a; b] is not a unit interval and b  c. We
 also have that FO(f0ip; 2ipg)! 14ii. Indeed
 xi14iizi $ 8wp(xi0ipwp $ zi0ipwp) ^
 9wp(zi2ipwp ^ :xi2ipwp):
 Putting all this together we can define 4ip:
 xi4ipyp $ 9zi(xi14iizi ^ ziR2yp):

 A symmetric argument shows that FO(f4ip; 2ipg)! 0ip. As
 for the case FO(f0ip; 4ipg) ! 2ip, consider any structure
 hD; I(D); 0ip; 4ipi. Define R3  I(D) D such that xiR3yp
 iff :(xi0ipyp) ^ :(xi4ipyp). Thus [a; b]R3c iff a  c  b.
 It is then not difficult to see that

 The cases FO(f0ipg) 6! 2ip and FO(f0ipg) 6! 4ip can be
 solved together. Consider the structure F3 = hD; I(D); 0ipi
 with D the ordering 0 < 1 < 2. Consider the automorphism
  = ( i;  p), where  i is the identity on I(D) and  p swaps
 1 and 2 leaving 0 fixed. This breaks 2ip since [0; 2]2ip1 but
 it is not the case that  i([0; 2])3ip p(1), i.e., that [0; 2]3ip2.
 It also breaks 4ip since [0; 1]4ip2 but it is not the case that
  i([0; 1])4ip p(2), i.e., that [0; 1]4ip1. A symmetric argument
 shows that FO(f4ipg) 6! 2ip and FO(f4ipg) 6! 0ip. Finally,
 as for the cases FO(f2ipg) 6! 0ip and FO(f2ipg) 6! 4ip,
 consider the structure F4 = hD; I(D); 2ipi with D the
 ordering 0 < 1 < 2. Consider the automorphism  = ( i;  p)
 where  i is the identity on I(D) and  p swaps 0 and 2 leaving
 1 fixed. This breaks 0ip since [1; 2]0ip0 but it is not the case
 that  i([1; 2])0ip p(0), i.e., that [1; 2]0ip2. It also breaks 4ip
 since [0; 1]4ip2 but it is not the case that  i([0; 1])4ip p(2),
 i.e., that [0; 1]4ip0.
 V. R+-COMPLETENESS AND INCOMPLETENESS
 We can now turn our attention to the set R+. As before,
 due to space constraints, the results will only be sketched.
 The situation for arbitrary linear orders is depicted in Fig. V.
 Lemma 9: Each set in the rightmost column of Tab. V is
 R+-complete over the class of all linear orders.
 Proof: We proceed case by case. To prove the complete-
 ness of f1ip; 3ipg we recall Lemma 5 (specifically the proof
 of the case for f1ip; 3ipg) and Theorem 3: as we already
 know that this fragment can express 34ii, we can deduce
 that it is both M+- and I+-complete; therefore, by simply
 observing that we can express < and =p in the fragment,
 we are done:
 xp < yp $ 9zi(zi1ipxp ^ zi3ipyp);
 xp =p yp $ 8zi(zi1ipxp $ zi1ipyp):
 Next, we observe that the sets f2ip; 3ipg; f1ip; 4ipg;
 f0ip; 3ipg; and f1ip; 2ipg are M+-complete by Lemma 5,
 and, thus, 1ip and 3ip can be expressed, which implies that
 they are all R+-complete thanks to the previous result. Con-
 sider, now, the case f34ii; 3ipg. From the previous results,
 we know it suffices to express 2ip in this fragment to prove
 its completeness. Recalling that 34ii is I+-complete, we can
 use any I+-relation, and so:
 xi2ipyp $ 9zi(zi14iixi ^ zi3ipyp):
 Bearing in mind that 01ii is definable in terms 34ii, being
 its inverse, the case f34ii; 1ipg can be treated symmetrically.
 The case f14ii; 3ipg can be sorted out by simply defining 2ip
 by means of the same equation as in the previous case, and
 the case f03ii; 1ipg comes by symmetry. The set f34ii; 0ip; <
 g can be proved to be R+-complete by observing that 1ip is
 expressible, and, then, recalling that we have already shown
 the R+-completeness of f34ii; 1ipg:
 xi1ipyp $ 8zp(xi 0ip zp $ zp < yp):
 Symmetrically, from f34ii; 4ip; <g we express 3ip, and ex-
 ploit the completeness of f34ii; 3ipg. In the case f34ii; 2ip; <
 g, we can define one of 0ip, 1ip, or 3ip to reduce to one of
 the previous cases:
 xi 0ip yp $ 9zi9wp((xi03iizi) ^ (zi2ipwp) ^
 (:xi2ipwp) ^ (yp < wp))
 As for the case of f14ii; 4ip; <g, we can exploit the com-
 pleteness of f14ii; 3ipg shown above. This can be done by
 means of the following equation:
 xi3ipyp $ 8zp(xi4ipzp $ yp < zp):
 Symmetrically, f03ii; 0ip; <g can be proven complete by
 exploiting the completeness of f03ii; 1ipg. In the case of
MIS(R+)s mcs(R+)s
 I+ [ f0ip; 2ip; 4ip;=i;=pg f1ip; 3ipg; f34ii; 0ip; <g
 I+ [ f<;=i;=pg f2ip; 3ipg; f34ii; 2ip; <g
 f14ii; 0ip; 1ip; <;=i;=pg f1ip; 4ipg; f34ii; 4ip; <g
 f03ii; 3ip; 4ip; <;=i;=pg f0ip; 3ipg; f14ii; 4ip; <g
 f04ii; 24ii; 44ii; 2ip; <;=i;=pg f1ip; 2ipg; f03ii; 0ip; <g
 f24ii; 04ii; 44ii; 0ip; 1ip; <;=i;=pg f34ii; 1ipg; f14ii; 2ip; <g
 f24ii; 04ii; 44ii; 3ip; 4ip; <;=i;=pg f34ii; 3ipg; f03ii; 2ip; <g
 f14ii; 3ipg; f0ip; 2ip; <g
 f03ii; 1ipg; f2ip; 4ip; <g
 Table V
 MINIMAL R+-COMPLETE AND MAXIMAL R+-INCOMPLETE SETS.
 f14ii; 2ip; <g, we define 4ip and exploit the completeness
 of f14ii; 4ip; <g:
 xi 4ip yp $ 9zi9wp((xi14iizi) ^ (zi2ipwp) ^
 (:xi2ipwp) ^ (wp < yp)):
 Once again, we can solve the case of f03ii; 2ip; <g by
 symmetry, making use of the completeness of f03ii; 0ip; <g.
 Finally, the set f0ip; 2ip; <g can be proven to be complete
 by expressing 1ip:
 xi1ipyp $ 8zp(xi0ipzp $ zp < yp);
 and, symmetrically, the set f2ip; 4ip; <g can be proven to be
 complete by expressing 3ip.
 Lemma 10: Each set in the leftmost column of Tab. V is
 R+-incomplete over the class of all linear orders.
 Proof: Let us work case-by case, starting with the
 R+-incompleteness of I+[f0ip; 2ip; 4ip;=i;=pg. Consider
 the structure F = hD = fa < bg; I(D); Si, where
 S = I+[f0ip; 2ip; 4ip;=i;=pg. Define  = ( i;  p) as a pair
 of functions  i : I(D) ! I(D) such that  ([a; b]) 7! [a; b],
 and  p : D ! D such that  p(a) 7! b and  p(b) 7! a. We
 claim that  is an automorphism of F . Indeed,  is clearly
 a bijection, and, further, no pair of intervals is r-related, for
 any r 2 I+; moreover, as there are only two points, and
 no interval in the structure is related to any point which
 is before, after, or inside it,  respects the three interval-
 point relations; finally, equality of both sorts is respected
 too. It is also clear that  does not respect, for example,
 the relation 3ip, as [a; b]3ipb, while it is not the case that
  ([a; b])3ip (b). Therefore 3ip cannot be expressed in this
 language, and thus the considered set must be incomplete.
 In the case of I+ [ f<;=i;=pg, we consider the structure
 F = hZ; I(Z); Si, where S = I+ [ f<;=i;=pg, and
 define  = ( i;  p) such that  i is the identity function
 over I(D), and  p(n) = n + 1 for all n 2 Z. Then  is
 an automorphism of F , clearly being a bijection respecting
 all I+-relations and the ordering among the points. At the
 same time, the relations between the points and the intervals
 are not respected by  , which shows that no interval-point
 relation can be expressed, making S incomplete. As for
 the case f14ii; 0ip; 1ip; <;=i;=pg, we consider the structure
 F = hQ; I(Q); Si, where Q is the set or rational numbers
 with their usual ordering, and S = f14ii; 0ip; 1ip; <;=i;=p
 g. Define  as a pair of functions  = ( i;  p), where
  i : I(Q) ! I(Q) such that  : [a; b] 7! [a; a + 2  jb  aj];
 and where  p is the identical function over Q. In other
 words, the image of any interval [a; b] under  has the same
 beginning point, but double the length of [a; b]. We claim
 that  is an automorphism of the structure F . It is clear
 that  is a bijection. Further, [a1; b1] 14ii [a2; b2] if and only
 if a1 = a2 and b1 < b2, that is, if and only if a1 = a2
 and a1 + 2  jb1  a1j < a2 + 2  jb2  a2j, which happens
 if and only if  ([a1; b1]) 14ii  ([a2; b2]). Finally, points are
 identically related to each other under  , implying that <
 is respected, and if a point is the beginning (resp., before
 the beginning) point of an interval, it remains so under  ,
 proving that  respects 0ip and 1ip. Now, we show that 44ii
 cannot be defined in this language, for which it is enough
 to observe that, since  ([0; 1]) = [0; 2] and  ([2; 3]) = [2; 4],
 for all formulas ?(x; y) of this language, we have that
 F j= ?([0; 1]; [2; 3]) if and only if F j= ?([0; 2]; [2; 4]), but,
 at the same time, [0; 1]44ii[2; 3] and :([0; 2]44ii[2; 4]). The
 case f03ii; 3ip; 4ip; <;=i;=pg is symmetric. Following the
 same idea, the set f04ii; 24ii; 44ii; 2ip; <;=i;=pg is shown
 incomplete by considering a structure F = hD = fa <
 b < cg; I(D); Si, where S = f04ii; 24ii; 44ii; 2ip; <;=i
 ;=pg, and by defining  = ( i;  p) as a pair of func-
 tions  i : I(D) ! I(D) is such that  ([a; c]) 7! [a; c],
  ([a; b]) 7! [b; c], and  ([b; c]) 7! [a; b], while  p : D ! D
 is the identical function. As before,  is an automorphism
 of F , as it is a bijection, it respects all interval-interval and
 interval-point relations, and it does not involve equalities.
 Obviously, 34ii is not respected, and therefore the set is
 incomplete. Finally, a very similar construction shows that
 f24ii; 04ii; 44ii; 0ip; 1ip; <;=i;=pg is incomplete; it suffices
 to define, over the same structure as before, the automor-
 phism  = ( i;  p), where  i : I(D) ! I(D) is such that
  ([a; b]) 7! [a; c],  ([a; c]) 7! [a; b], and  ([b; c]) 7! [b; c],
 while  p : D ! D is the identical function; as the
 initial point of the intervals is respected, 0ip and 1ip are
respected as well, and, again, 34ii is not. Modulo taking
 inverses of some relations, a symmetrical argument proves
 the incompleteness of f24ii; 04ii; 44ii; 3ip; 4ip; <;=i;=pg.
 Now, Theorem 11 follows from lemmas 9 and 10 together
 with the observation that each proper subset of a minimally
 complete set is contained in an incomplete one and each
 proper extension of an incomplete set contains a complete
 set.
 Theorem 11: The minimal R+-complete and maximal
 R+-incomplete sets over the class of all linear orders are
 those and only those shown in Tab. V.
 VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
 We considered here two-sorted first-order temporal lan-
 guages including relations between intervals, points, and
 inter-sort. We analyzed the fragments of this language con-
 taining respectively, only interval-interval relations and only
 inter-sort relations, giving complete classifications of their
 sub-fragments w.r.t. expressive power. We have found that
 there are 19 expressively different extensions of first-order
 logic with interval relations, and 10 with inter-sort relations.
 Lastly, we have considered the extension of two-sorted first-
 order logic with all the above mentioned relations, restricting
 ourselves to the identification of all expressively complete
 fragments and all maximal expressively incomplete frag-
 ments, laying some foundations for a forthcoming complete
 classification. We plan to complete this classification, as well
 as to consider this problem for different classes of linear
 orderings and of branching orderings.
