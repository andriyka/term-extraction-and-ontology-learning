A Formalization of Structured Temporal Objects and Repetition Diana Cukierman and James Delgrande Abstract.
We propose an approach to formally representing structured temporal objects.
These new temporal objects are recursively made up of convex intervals and Allenas convex relations.
The major emphasis in our approach is on temporal repetition.
To that effect we define the time loop.
Time loops allow us to abstract common elements in repetitive temporal patterns.
A loop is essentially parameterized by a cycle which is a structured temporal element possibly including subloops, a relation between instances of the cycle and a repetitions number.
Atemporal assertions are true during these temporal objects, and thus this formalism allows one to concisely represent and reason with assertions which have an inherent temporal structure.
Hence, this formalism allows one to concisely represent, for example, the scheduling of regular meetings in a university, where a meeting may in turn be composed of structured temporal elements.
1  Introduction  We propose an approach based on convex interval relations [1] to formally representing structured temporal objects.
The simplest structured temporal object is a related pair, consisting of two temporal objects with some (interval) relation between them.
As well, we have sets of related pairs and time loops.
Our primary object of interest is the time loop, used to represent temporal repetition.
Atemporal assertions are true during these temporal objects.
The key contribution of this formalism is that we propose a language that treats related intervals (and recursively, related temporal objects) as a structured object, as opposed to a relation among such intervals.
This corresponds to the intuition that such structured temporal objects are composite entities, similar for example to physical objects which are made up of different components.
In particular, calendar time units are composite temporal objects with a particular structure.
Similarly, we view a set of composite and related activities and events (possibly repetitive), for example medical treatments, as occurring during temporally structured objects, and thus ainheritinga such structure.
We abstract (possibly infinite) lists of temporal terms which follow certain repetitive structure with a new temporal term, a loop.
We assume that (at some level of abstraction) every occurrence of a repetition or repeat in a sequence of events is athe samea; see [15] for a philosophical analysis.
Here we only deal with qualitative information describing a loop repetitive structure.
Four parameters provide the necessary information to define a loop: a single (representative) cycle, an order relation between consecutive instances of the cycle or repeats and a repetitions number ; the fourth parameter, an index,   Simon Fraser University, email:  diana,jim  @cs.sfu.ca  Burnaby,  B.C.,  V5A1S6,  Canada,  distinguishes individual loops which have the same structure parameters.
A loop cycle can be an interval, but it can also be recursively made up of other (related) intervals and/or other loops.
Previous work in the Artificial Intelligence and Temporal Databases communities have dealt with some sort of structured temporal objects, both interval or point based such as non-convex intervals and linear repeating points; these temporal objects however only provide a asingle levela structure.
Non-convex intervals are sets of non-intersecting intervals, which aconsist intuitively of some (maximal) convex subintervals with convex gaps in between thema [11], page 360.
Ligozatas generalized intervals [13] are ordered sequences of points which can also denote non-convex intervals.
Linear repeating points, (lrps) are defined within generalized databases.
They are mathematical characterization of periodic, and possibly infinite point sequences, with a finite representation [9].
Nearly periodic points [18] and linear repeating intervals (lris) [16] extend lrps.
Lris are akin to non-convex intervals where subintervals have the same duration and are equally distanced.
Temporal granularities research also deals with structure in time, although focused on calendars and calendar-based time units [4, 6, 12, 16].
In contrast, we propose temporal objects which are not calendar based, although they permit one to define calendar-based temporal objects.
The language presented here can include any structure with a finite number of nested structured temporal objects, with any qualitative structure; hence a temporal object may include arbitrary gaps.
Space limitations preclude that we include more related literature.
The next section introduces the language and presents the proposed axioms for each temporal object, along with examples and some results which follow from the axiomatization.
The theory is augmented in Section 3 with the HOLDS predicate and general formulas, with which atemporal assertions are expressed to be true during a certain temporal term.
Results are then presented which illustrate the expressive and reasoning power of this theory.
Finally, a comparison of this formalism with other work, and comments on current and future research, are provided.
2  The terms in the language  The following examples intuitively illustrate the expressive power of temporal terms.

(The first parameter,   , is an index.)

The relation in the related-pair holds between the two temporal objects each considered aas a wholea; a temporal object is considered aas a wholea by considering its convexification via the cvx functor.
Briefly: a convexified temporal object is the smallest interval including all the subintervals in the object and is written cvx( ).

       %    Temporal repetition: Loops This section presents the loops axioms, intermixed with examples, other axioms and clarifications.
Recall that a loop is defined by four parameters: its index, its cycle, an inter-repeat relation and a repetitions number.
Axiom l.1 defines a loop and its parameters.

(    )  )  We propose that associated with a loop there are repeats (as many as the repetitions number), all of which have the same ashapea as the cycleas.
aSame-shapenessa is used as a similarity criterion among repeats here.
Other similarity relations could involve alternative qualitative considerations or quantitative information.
For example, temporal terms could be required to have the same duration.
The predicate same shape formalizes this concept, and is used in Axiom l.2.
This is where our formalization connects with the intuition of a closed time structure in the sense that repeats are athe samea.
Indeed, we propose that a loop stands for many repeats, all with the same shape (and therefore representable by) the cycle.
Additionally, the cycle itself (as a temporal term) represents a specific repeat, the first one.
This is what Axiom l.3 expresses.
Notice that the index is irrelevant with respect to the loop shape.
Same shape is an equivalence relation; additionally the axioms sh.1 to sh.4 hold.

  To simplify the formalism, another loop axiom requires that no loop with repetitions number &Q' can be within a loop cycle.
2.2  A new temporal relation and composition of loops  We present the definition of a new temporal relation between loops, primarily to illustrate the power of the formalism.
We show how this relation compares with analogous relations defined in previous related work about anon-convexa intervals [11].
Further we present essentially the same concept but as a composition operation of two loops.
This introduces a different perspective to the concept, leading to a more succinct way of expressing repetitive temporal patterns.
In previous sections we have dealt with relations between any temporal term when considering their convexification, i.e.
considering terms as a whole.
Many other relations exist between temporal terms when taking into account their subcomponents.
Furthermore, it is possible to define relations between temporal terms which take into account their defining parameters, their inner structure, and so on.
Here we present one relation between two loops taking into account (all of) the respective repeats, and each repeat considered as a whole: a 5 a, where 5 is an Allen convex interval relation.
The  5 relation is one of the possible extensions of the relation aalways Ra between non-convex intervals as defined in [11], where aRa is an Allen relation.
In the referred paper binary relations between non-convex intervals include those that take into account subintervals (such as aalways Ra, asometimes Ra), and other relations which take the non-convex interval as a whole (via its convexification).
Briefly, we define the relation  5 to hold between two loops when the relation 5 holds between their respective convexified repeats.
Axioms are omitted for lack of space.
Example 3 Consider the situation asometimes lunches meet seminars, sometimes lunches are before seminarsa.
This type of example appears in [14] where a formalism based on Ladkinas non-convex intervals is introduced.
One way of defining this situation in our language is with two loops, a lunches loop and a seminars loop, and 3 	 	 	 2  	4 relating them with the relation  .
  This example is revisited below, under a different perspective, by using one single loop.
Observation 2 If the cycles of two loops have some temporal term in common then for some Allen relation 5 , the  5 relation may be inconsistent.
Proof We prove this with an example,  where the relation  fi  % .

It is not possible that  Composition of loops An alternative way of seeing relations such as  5 is by considering a new temporal loop which results from composing two other loops.
We define a loop  to be composed by loops   and  and the Allen relation 5 when its    repeat is a related pair, where the first component in the pair is the    repeat of loop   , the second component is the    repeat of loop  and the relation in the related pair is 5 .

This theorem illustrates the expressive power of loops in our language.
Certain repetitive temporal patterns can be expressed succinctly with a single loop whose cycle is a structured temporal object.
In contrast, if one considers interval cycle loops (analogous to nonconvex intervals), several of such loops are required, together with the -5 relation.
Under this perspective, we review Example 3; Example 4 aSometimes lunches meet seminars, sometimes lunches fi are before seminarsa can be expressed with the loop  seminar 3 	 	 	 2  	4  	 	   lunch , ,n).
This loop is the composition of the two 3 	 	 	 2  	4 loops lunches and seminars, and relation   Clearly, Observation 2 above about the  5 relation can be seen as referring to the (non)-existence of such composed loop, given the equivalence in Theorem 1.
Other interesting results follow from considering composed loops and the interconnection between the loops inter-repeat relation and the composing relation.
3  Formulas: atemporal assertions associated to temporal terms  We next consider how one can reason with atemporal assertions that are true during temporal terms.
In common with previous work [2, 17] we introduce HOLDS formulas, where an atomic formula consists of the HOLDS predicate with two arguments: a temporal term as defined in98 previous sections and a reified proposition.

We treat atemporal assertions as Allenas properties in that something is true during an interval if it is true during all the intervals within.
This extends nicely to the behaviour of atemporal assertions during composite temporal terms, since we require that an assertion is true during a temporal term if it is true during all its subcomponents.
See Axiom H.1 and Theorem 2.
Composed formulas are related with the usual logical connec3   ) R4 tives .
Similarly to the referred work we apply the  operators not, and, or and implies to atemporal assertions and  .

The interpretation we give to negation is that of strong negation, akin8 to the negation for properties in 8 Allenas formalization.
Hence not( ) holds during a temporal term if does not hold during any of the temporal term subcomponents.
The astrong negationa is not equivalent but it implies the aweak nega8 ) would hold during a temporal term tiona; with weak negation not( 8 if does not hold during the temporal term itself.
See Axiom H.2 and Theorem 3.
We use the predicate subcomponent to shorten the axioms presentation.
Intuitively: intervals which are .in.
an interval make up its subcomponents; the two components in a related pair are subcomponents of the related pair; the first and rest of a ret are its subcomponents and the repeats associated to a loop are its subcomponents.
Furthermore, subcomponents of subcomponents are also subcomponents of a temporal term.

The exponentiation property does not apply to loops which do not evolve forward or backward such as for example having overlaps as the inter-repeat relation.
fi    fi  	  fi   4    Discussion and Related Work  We have presented an approach to formally characterize time with structured temporal objects.
Based on convex intervals, we have defined temporal objects which are composed themselves of temporal terms related in certain ways.
This is analogous to how complex objects are composed of different parts and sub-parts.
In particular we deal with temporal repetition, represented with time loops.
A time loop captures in one cycle the core of what is repeated; a loop cycle consists of an interval or a structured object (including other subloops).
The loopas inter-repeat relation specifies the relation that holds between each repetition; it can be any interval relation.
Hence, overlapping intervals or sequences of intervals going abackwardsa in time are possible.
We have also formalized loops where the repetitions number of the loop is the transfinite number &' .
The approach is formalized in first order logic.
The language includes temporal terms and a HOLDS predicate which has two arguments: a structured temporal term and a (reified) proposition which holds during the temporal term.
Several results are presented which intuitively show that the theory behaves correctly.
Our language allows for the compact representation of repeated temporal entities.
This would be appropriate for situations where similarities between repeats are known, which is the case in many practical applications.
Hence we provide an abstraction mechanism for temporal objects, and so propose (and allow) a further degree of structure in temporal knowledge bases.
We are aware of one medical system [5] that has recently incorporated these ideas based on our previous version of the language [7].
Examples such as lunches meet seminarsor lunches3 are before seminars are covered fi 	 	 	  2  	04 	 	 within one loop:  seminar   lunch , ,n).
This type of example appears in [14].
o express the above example with  non-convex intervals instead of loops, there would exist two different non-convex intervals, aseminarsa and alunchesa, one corresponding to the set of seminars and the other to the lunches.
This example would then be expressed as a relation between correlated pairs using non-convex intervals: each single seminar meets or is after each single aclosesta lunch.
In the presented formalism the linking relation between aclosesta seminars and lunches is made explicit, as being part of a cycle given in the loop construct.
As mentioned above, work in formalizing calendars and time units also deals with structured time.
However, such work is focused on calendar-based notions, and does not attempt to present a formalization of what (structured) temporal repetition essentially is.
We here propose a generic paradigm to treat time; we formalize it with temporal objects which include structure (via qualitative relations in this document).
Furthermore we propose a succinct way of representing repetitive temporal patterns.
Current and future research includes exploring results that follow from the axiomatization, formally proving the consistency of the theory and a study of the suitability of this formalism to reason within practical applications.
Constraint propagation algorithms which apply to the defined temporal objects and profit from the specific (one cycle based) structure that we propose are also part of future research.
An extension is to incorporate quantitative information into the formalism.
This would allow one for example to quantitatively specify calendars and granularity systems in general.
