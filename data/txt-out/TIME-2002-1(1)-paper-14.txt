Indexed Flows in Temporal x Modal Logic with Functional Semantics Alfredo Burrieza, Inma P. de Guzman and Emilio Munoz Universidad de Malaga Campus de Teatinos.
29071 Malaga, Spain guzman, emilio@ctima.uma.es burrieza@uma.es  Abstract Two classical semantical approaches to studying logics which combine time and modality are the T x W-frames and Kamp-frames (see Thomason, 84).
In this paper we study a new kind of frame that extends the one introduced in [Burrieza and P. de Guzman(2002)].
The motivation is twofold: theoretical, i.e., representing properties of the basic theory of functions (definability); and practical, their use in computational applications (considering time-flows as memory of computers connected in a net, each computer with its own clock).
Specifically, we present a temporal x modal (labelled) logic, whose semantics are given by indfunctional frames in which accessibility functions are used in order to interconnect time-flows.
This way, we can: (i) specify to what time-flow we want to go; (ii) carry out different comparisons among worlds with different time measures, and (iii) define properties of certain kinds of functions (in particular, of total, injective, surjective, constant, increasing and decreasing functions), without the need to resort to second-order theories.
In addition, we define a minimal axiomatic system and give the completeness theorem (Henkin-style).

Introduction Two classical semantical approaches to study logics which combine time and modality are the T x W-frames and Kamp-frames (see Thomason, 84).
In this paper we study a new kind of frame that extends the one introduced in [Burrieza and P. de Guzman(2002)].
The motivation is twofold: theoretical, i.e., representing properties of the basic theory of functions (definability); and practical, their use in computational applications (considering time-flows as memory of computers connected in a net, each computer with its own clock).
The semantic approach introduced in [Burrieza and P. de Guzman(2002)], named functional, allows us to esta-  blish connections among time-flows in very different ways, which enables us to carry out different comparisons among worlds with different time measures.
These connections are made by means of functions, called accessibility functions, and not by means of equivalence relations, as in T x Wframes and Kamp-frames approaches.
The theoretical study is interesting itself but also, in our opinion, and according to our experience when contacting users (who require applications for information and communication technologies), the functional approach considered in this paper is more adequate to the specifications used by them.
Specifically, we present a temporal x modal (labelled) logic, whose semantics are given by ind-functional frames in which accessibility functions are used in order to interconnect time-flows.
This way, we can: (i) specify to what time-flow we want to go; (ii) carry out different comparisons among worlds with different time measures, and (iii) define basic properties of some kinds of functions (in particular, of total, injective, surjective, constant, increasing, and decreasing functions), without the need to resort to secondorder theories.
Thus, we require to label time-flows, so that our language will include indexed-modal connectives, that is, < i >-type connectives, so that an expression such as <i> A can be intuitively read as follows: "A is true in flow i at the image of the reference instant (or where I am)".
In addition, we define a minimal axiomatic system and give the completeness theorem (Henkin-style).
The article is organized as follows: in Sect.
2 we introduce the family of temporal-(indexed-modal) languages and define its (algebraic-style) semantics.
In Sect.
3 we present the results about definability of function properties.
Finally, in Sect.
4 we give the proof of completeness of a minimal system for partial functions.

Languages LF (T xW ) -I Given a denumerable set of indices I, the alphabet of the language LF (T xW ) -I is defined as follows: 1) a denumerable set, V, of propositional variables; 2) the logic constants  Proceedings of the Ninth International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning (TIME'02) 1530-1311/02 $17.00 (c) 2002 IEEE   and [?
], and the boolean connectives !, [?
], [?]
and -; 3) the temporal connectives G and H; 4) a family of unary modal connectives of the form <i>, for i [?]
I.
The well-formed formulas (wffs) are generated by the construction rules of classical propositional logic, adding the following rule: If A is a wff, then GA, HA and <i> A are wffs.
We consider, as usual, the connectives F , P and [ i ] to be defined connectives.
The connectives G and H have their usual readings, but < i > A has the following meaning: A is true in flow i, at the image of the reference instant (from which I execute or speak).
For its part, [ i ]A has the following non-existential meaning: if there exists an image of the reference instant in flow i, then A is true at such an image and [ i ]A is true at the reference instant when this has no i-image.
So, if such an image exists in flow i, <i>A has the same meaning as [ i ]A.  called an ind-functional interpretation, satisfying the following conditions: The interpretation of the constants and of the boolean connectives is defined as usual,  2.1.
Semantics for LF (T xW ) -I  3  Definition 1 An ind-functional frame for LF (T xW ) -I is a tuple S = (W, T , F), where W is a nonempty set (set of labels for a set of time-flows), T is a nonempty set of strict linear orders, indexed by W , specifically: T = {(Tw , <w ) | w [?]
W }, where each Tw is non empty and, if w = w , then Tw [?]
Tw = [?].
Finally, F is a set of non-empty functions, called accessibility functions, such that:  In this section we introduce a minimal axiomatic system for LF (T xW ) -I to work with partial functions.
1. each function in F is a partial function from Tw to Tw , for some w [?]
W and some w [?]
W [?]
I 1 ; 2. for an arbitrary pair (w, w ) [?]
W x (W [?]
I), there is (in F) at most one accessibility function from Tw to w w  Tw , denoted by -- .
w w  We will  denote Fw = { -- [?]
F | w [?]
W }.
Then F = w[?
]W  Fw .
The elements tw of the disjoint union CoorS = w[?
]W Tw are called coordinates.
Note that the definition of W and T depends only on the set (of labels) W , whereas F depends on W and I.
Notation 1 If tw [?]

CoorS : - [tw , -) = {tw | tw <=w tw }; (tw , -) = {tw | tw <w tw }.
- (-, tw] = {tw | tw <=w tw };(-, tw ) = {tw | tw <w tw }.
- C |= tw [?

CoorS | (-, tw ) [?]
h(A)} w i - h(<i> A) = {tw [?]
CoorS |-- ({tw }) [?]
h(A) = [?]}.
Thus, the semantics of [ i ] is the following: w i  h([ i ]A) = {tw [?]
CoorS | -- ({tw }) [?]
h(A)} The notions of satisfiability, validity and logical equivalence (denoted [?])
are defined in a standard way.
As a consequence of the semantics, [ i ]A is valid in every indfunctional frame, S = (W, T , F) such that I [?]
W = [?].

Indeed, if condition a) is satisfied, then it is enough to take 2 = 1 .
On the other hand, if condition b) is satisfied, then Lindenbaum's lemma guarantees that there exists at least one mc extension, 2 , such that G3 [?

PhS (ti ).
We say that (3) is exhausted if its consequent is fulfilled, that is, there w i exists a ti =-- (tw ) such that A [?]
PhS (ti ).
Lemma 3 (trace lemma) Let PhS be an full trace of an indfunctional frame S = (W, T , F) and h an ind-functional interpretation assigning each propositional variable, p, the set h(p) = {tw [?]
CoorS | p [?]
PhS (tw )}.
Then, for any formula A, we have h(A) = {tw [?]
CoorS | A [?]
PhS (tw )} In order to prove the completeness theorem, for each consistent formula, A, we will construct (using the class Ks in definition 10) an ind-functional frame S = (W, T , F) and a full trace, PhS , such that A [?]
PhS (tw ) for some tw [?]
CoorS .
To this end, we define: - an enumeration of WKs : WKs = {wn | n [?]
N}.
 - an enumeration of TKs = w[?
]WKs Tw :  TKs = n[?
]N Twn ; Twn = {t(n,m) | m [?]
N} - an enumeration of LF (T xW ) -I: A0 , A1 , .
.
.
An , .
.
.
.
Therefore, we can also assign a code number for each prophetic conditional (historic conditional, ind-possibilistic conditional, etc.)
in the usual way.
Now, given a consistent formula A, the construction of S and PhS goes step by step as follows: We begin with a finite ind-functional frame S0 = (W0 , T0 , F0 ) [?]
Ks, with W0 = {w0 }, where w0 [?]
WKs - I; T0 = {({t(0,0) }, [?
])}, F0 = [?]
and a trace PhS0 , such that PhS0 (t(0,0) ) = G0 , where G0 is an mc-set containing A.
Assume that Sn = (Wn , Tn , Fn ) and PhSn are defined.
Then Sn+1 and PhSn+1 are defined as follows:  * If all conditionals are not active, then Sn+1 = Sn , PhSn+1 = PhSn and the construction is finished.
* Otherwise, i.e., if there is some conditional (a) for PhSn which is active, then we choose the conditional (a ) with the lowest code number and the exhausting lemma below ensures that there exists a finite extension Sn+1 = (Wn+1 , Tn+1 , Fn+1 ) of Sn and a finite extension PhSn+1 of PhSn , such that the conditional (a ) for PhSn+1 is exhausted.
The result is a sequence of finite ind-functional frames (W0 , T0 , F0 ), (W1 , T1 , F1 ), ..., (Wn , Tn , Fn ), ..., whose union is the ind-functional frame S, and a sequence of corresponding traces, PhS0 , PhS1 , .
.
.
, PhSn , .
.
.
, whose union is PhS .
Each finite ind-functional frame of the above sequence satisfies the condition of linearity of temporal orders and each trace of it is coherent, but in general, it fails to be prophetic, historic or ind-possibilistic.
However, as we shall show, the trace PhS has all these properties.
Finally, we will demonstrate that the trace lemma ensures that A is satisfied in S. Lemma 4 (Exhausting lemma) Let Ks be as in definition 10, PhSn a coherent trace of an ind-functional frame Sn = (Wn , Tn , Fn ) [?]
Ks and let (a) be a prophetic (historic or ind-possibilistic) conditional for PhSn which is active.
Then there exists a coherent trace PhSn+1 , extension of PhSn , such that (a) is a conditional for PhSn+1 which is exhausted.
Proof: The proof for prophetic or historic conditionals is standard in temporal logic.
Consider the special case of indpossibilistic conditionals.
Let PhSn be a coherent trace of an ind-functional frame Sn = (Wn , Tn , Fn ) [?]
Ks, let i [?]
I and assume that the following ind-possibilistic conditional for PhSn is active: (2) if <i> A [?]
PhSn (tw ), then there exists w i  ti =-- (tw ) such that A [?]
PhSn (ti ).
Thus, we have that < i > A [?]
PhSn (tw ), but there is no w i ti =-- (tw ) such that A [?]
PhSn (ti ).
Now, we have to consider two cases: I) i [?]
/ Wn .
Then, by item 2 (c) in lemma 1, there exists an mc-set, G, such that PhSn (tw ) [?
]i G and A [?]
G; then we need a new flow of time labelled with i, Ti , which requires to extend Wn and, also, to introduce a new w i coordinate ti associated with G so that ti =-- (tw ).
So, we proceed as follows: - Wn+1 = Wn [?]
{i}  Proceedings of the Ninth International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning (TIME'02) 1530-1311/02 $17.00 (c) 2002 IEEE  - Tn+1 = Tn [?]
{(Ti , <i )}, where (Ti , <i ) = ({ti }, [?])
w i  w i  w i  - Fn+1 = F [?]
{--}, where --= {(tw , ti )} - PhSn+1 = PhSn [?]
{(ti , G)} It is immediate that linearity is preserved and that PhSn+1 is coherent.
II) i [?]
Wn .
In this case, we must consider the following situations: w i  (ii.b.1) G = PhSn (t1i ) (ii.b.2) G [?
]T PhSn (t1i ) (ii.b.3) PhSn (t1i ) [?
]T G  w i  (II.2) -- is not defined in Fn .
w i  (II.1): Let ti be the minimum 3 of -- (Tw ) and tw w i such that ti =-- (tw ).
Thus, we have that  For case (ii.b.1) the reasoning is the same as in (i).
The case (ii.b.2) gives rise to PhSn (ti ) [?
]T G [?
]T PhSn (t1i )  (+1 )  Then we select a new coordinate, ti , to associate it to G. Thus:  PhSn (tw ),  and, since PhSn (tw ) ~T we obtain PhSn (tw ) & PhSn (tw ).
On the other hand, it is evident that PhSn (tw ) & PhSn (tw ).
Thus, by diamond theorem, from (+1 ) we obtain that there exists an mc-set, G, such that PhSn (tw ) [?
]i G  G ~T PhSn (ti )  and  Tn+1 = (Tn - {(Ti , <i )}) [?]
{(Ti , <i )}, where - Ti = Ti [?]
{ti } - <i = <i [?]
{(ti , ti ), (ti , t1i )} [?]
{(t*i , ti ) | t*i <i ti } [?]
{(ti , t*i ) | t1i <i t*i } Fn+1 and PhSn+1 are defined as in (*) and (**) respectively.
(+2 )  (+2 ) means that one of the following three conditions is satisfied:  Linearity in the new frame and coherence of the new trace are again preserved.
In case (ii.b.3) we consider the immediate successor of t1i , namely t2i , and we proceed in a similar way.
By iterating this operation at most s times, we fix the image of tw associating an mc-set to it, preserving coherence and linearity.
Finally, case (iii) is analogous to case (ii).
(i) G = PhSn (ti ); (ii) PhSn (ti ) [?
]T G; (iii) G [?
]T PhSn (ti ).
In all of these cases we have Wn+1 = Wn .
Now, - if item (i) holds, we have: Tn+1 = Tn ; w i  w i  Fn+1 = (Fn - {--}) [?]
{-- }, where w i  w i  -- =-- [?]
{(tw , ti )} PhSn+1 = PhSn It is evident that PhSn+1 is coherent.
- if item (ii) holds, we have to consider the number of successors of ti in Ti : (ii.a) if the number of successors of ti in Ti is zero, then a new coordinate ti is chosen, to be associated with G and we have: Tn+1 = (Tn - {(Ti , <i )}) [?]
{(Ti , <i )}, where - Ti = Ti [?]
{ti } - <i = <i [?]
{(ti , ti )} [?]
{(t*i , ti ) | t*i <i ti } 3 We  could also consider the maximum.
w i  -- =-- [?]
{(tw , ti )} (*) PhSn+1 = PhSn [?]
{(ti , G)} (**) Clearly, linearity is preserved and lemma 1 completes the proof of the coherence of PhSn+1 .
(ii.b) On the other hand, if the number of successors of ti in Ti is s > 0, then we consider the immediate successor of ti , say t1i .
Now, since PhSn (ti ) [?
]T PhSn (t1i ), by item 4 (a) in lemma 1, we obtain one of the three following conditions:  (II.1) -- is defined in Fn .
PhSn (tw ) [?
]i PhSn (ti )  w i  w i  Fn+1 = (Fn - {--}) [?]
{-- }, where:  w i  Consider case (II.2), that is, -- is not defined in Fn .
It means (by construction of Sn ) that then there will w i  be some time-flow, Tw , with w = w and -- [?]
Fn .
w i  Let ti be the minimum of -- (Tw ) and tw such that w i  -- (tw ) = ti .
Thus PhSn (tw ) [?
]i PhSn (ti ).
Now, (again by construction of Sn ) we have three subcases: (II.2.1) PhSn (tw ) & PhSn (tw ) (II.2.2) PhSn (tw ) & PhSn (tw ) (II.2.3) there exists a flow Tw , with w = w and w = w , and there exists tw [?]
Tw such that: PhSn (tw ) & PhSn (tw ) and PhSn (tw )& PhSn (tw )  Proceedings of the Ninth International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning (TIME'02) 1530-1311/02 $17.00 (c) 2002 IEEE  In case (II.2.1), given that PhSn (tw ) & PhSn (tw ), by diamond theorem, there exists an mc-set G such that PhSn (tw ) [?
]i G and G ~T PhSn (ti ).
Thus, we can observe, once again, one of the three situations referred to in paragraph (II.1): (i) G = PhSn (ti ); (ii) PhSn (ti ) [?
]T G; (iii) G [?
]T PhSn (ti ).
