Extracting Uncertain Temporal Relations from Mined Frequent Sequences Francisco Guil Dept.
LyC Universidad de Almeria 04120 - Almeria, Spain fguil@ual.es  Abstract In this work we address an approach for solving the problem of building a temporal constraint network from the set of frequent sequences obtained after a temporal data mining process.
In particular, the temporal data mining algorithm used is TSET [7], an algorithm based on the inter-transactional framework that uses a unique tree-based structure to discover frequent sequences from datasets.
The model of temporal network is the proposed by Hadjali, Dubois and Prade [8] where each constraint is formed by three possibility values expressing the relative plausibility of each basic relations between two point-based events, that is, "before", "at the same time" and "after".
We propose the use of the Shafer Theory for computing the possibility values of the temporal relations involved in the network from the calculated probability masses of the sequences.
The final goal is to obtain a more understandable and useful sort of knowledge from a huge volume of temporal associations resulting after the data mining process.
1 Introduction Data mining is an essential step in the process of knowledge discovery in databases that consists of applying data analysis and discovery algorithms that produce a particular enumeration of structures over the data [6].
There are two types of structures: models and patterns.
So, we can talk about local and global methods in data mining.
In the case of local methods, the simplest case of pattern discovery is finding association rules [1].
The initial motivation for association rules was to aid in the analysis of large transactional databases.
The discovery of association rules can potentially aid decision making within organizations.
Since the problem of mining association rules was introduced by Agrawal in [1], a large amount of work has been done in several directions, including improvement of the Apriori algorithm, mining generalized, multi-level or  Roque Marin Dept.
IIC Universidad de Murcia 30100 - Murcia, Spain roque@dif.um.es  quantitative association rules, mining weighted association rules, fuzzy association rules mining, constraint-based rule mining, efficient long patterns mining, etc.
We want to point out the work in which a new type of association rules was introduced, the inter-transaction association rules [9].
Temporal data mining can be viewed as an extension of the aforementioned work.
Temporal data mining can be defined as the activity of looking for interesting correlations (or patterns) in large sets of temporal data accumulated for other purposes.
It has the capability of mining activity, inferring associations of contextual and temporal proximity, that could also indicate a cause-effect association.
This important kind of knowledge can be overlooked when the temporal component is ignored or treated as a simple numeric attribute [11].
In non-temporal data mining techniques, there are usually two different tasks: the description of the characteristics of the database (or analysis of the data), and the prediction of the evolution of the population.
However, in temporal data mining this distinction is less appropriate, because the evolution of the population is already incorporated in the temporal properties of the data being analyzed.
In [7] we presented an algorithm, named T SET , based on the inter-transactional framework for mining frequent sequences from several kind of datasets.
The improvement of the proposed solution was the use of a unique structure to store all frequent sequences.
The data structure used is the well-known set-enumeration tree, commonly used in the data mining area, in which the temporal semantic is incorporated.
The result is a set of frequent sequences describing partially the dataset.
This set forms a potential base of temporal information which, after the study and interpretation by human experts, can be very useful to obtain valuable knowledge.
However, the overwhelming number of discovered frequent sequences may make such a task absolutely impossible in practice.
This problem can be viewed as a second-order data mining problem which consists on the necessity of obtaining a more understandable and useful sort of knowledge from a huge volume of temporal associations  Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning (TIME'06) 1530-1311/06 $20.00 (c) 2006  IEEE  resulting after the data mining process.
In this work, we propose the building of an especial model of temporal networks formed by a set of uncertain relations amongst temporal points.
The temporal model, proposed by HadjAli, Dubois and Prade in [8], is based on the Possibility Theory as expressive tool for the representation and management of uncertainty in point-based temporal relations.
The uncertainty is represented by a vector describing three possibility values, expressing the relative plausibility of the three basic relations between two temporal points, that is, "before", "at the same time" and "after".
Also, the authors define the basic operations (inversion, composition, combination and negation) that enable us to infer new temporal information and to propagate uncertainty in a possibilistic way.
After obtaining the sequences base, which are characterized by a basic probability assignment function obtained from the frequencies of the sequences, we propose a Shafer Theory-based technique for calculating the possibility degrees of the basic temporal relations involved in the temporal relations between temporal points.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes briefly the T SET algorithm and gives a formal description of the problem of mining frequent sequences from datasets.
Section 3 introduces the formulae for obtaining the sequences base from the set of mined frequent sequences.
Section 4 describes briefly the representation aspects of the possibilistic temporal model.
In Section 5 we describe the approach for obtaining the uncertain vectors associated with the basic temporal relations from the sequences base.
Section 6 presents an example to illustrate the proposed approach.
Conclusions and future work are finally drawn in Section 7.  are generated only after all k-sequences have been generated.
On each cycle, the downward closure property is used to prune the search space.
This property, also called anti-monotonicity property, indicates that if a sequence is infrequent, then all super-sequence must also be infrequent.
In the sequel, we will introduce the terminologies and the definitions necessary to establish the problem of mining frequent sequences from large datasets.
2.1 Concepts and terminologies Definition 1 A dataset D is an ordered sequence of records D[0], D[1],...,D[r - 1] where each D[i] can have c columns or attributes, A[0], ..., A[c - 1].
The 0-attribute will be the dimensional attribute, the temporal data associated with the record, expressed in temporal units.
The rest of attributes can be quantitative or categorical.
We assume that the domain of each attribute is a finite subset of non-negative integers, and we also assume that the structure of time is discrete and linear.
Due to every event registered has its absolute date identified, we represent the time for events with an absolute dating system [10].
In order to simplify the calculations, we transform the original dataset subtracting the date of each record from the date of the first record, i.e.
the time origin.
Definition 2 An event e is a 3-tuple (A[i], v, t), where 0 < i < c, v [?]
dom{A[i]}, and t [?]
dom{A[0]}, that is, t [?]
N. Events are "things that happen", and they usually represent the dynamic aspect of the world [10].
In our case, an event is related to the fact that a value v is assigned to a certain attribute A[i] with the occurrence time t. The set of all distinct pairs (A[i],v) can be also called event types.
We will use the notation e.a, e.v, and e.t to set and get the attribute, value, and time variables related to the event e, and e.type to get the event type associated with it.
2 The T SET algorithm T SET is an algorithm designed for mining frequent sequences (or frequent temporal pattern) from large relational datasets.
It is based on the 1-dimensional inter-transactional framework [9], and therefore, the aim is to find associations of events amongst different records (or transactions), and not only the associations of events within records.
The main improvement of T SET is that it uses a unique tree-based structure to store all frequent sequences.
The data structure used is the well known set-enumeration tree [2, 3], in which the temporal semantic is incorporated.
The algorithm follows the same basic principles as most apriori-based algorithms [1].
Frequent sequence mining is an iterative process, and the focus is on a level-wise pattern generation.
Firstly, all frequent 1-sequences (frequent events) are found, these are used to generate frequent 2sequences, then 3-sequences are found using frequent 2sequences, and so on.
In other words, (k+1)-sequences  Definition 3 Given two events e 1 and e2 , we define the <= relation as follows: 1. e1 = e2 iff (e1 .t = e2 .t) [?]
(e1 .a = e2 .a) [?]
(e1 .v = e2 .v) 2. e1 < e2 iff (e1 .t < e2 .t) [?]
((e1 .t = e2 .t) [?]
(e1 .a < e2 .a)) 3. e1 <= e2 iff (e1 < e2 ) [?]
(e1 = e2) We assume that a lexicographic ordering exists among the pairs (attribute, value), the events types, in the dataset.
Definition 4 A sequence (or event sequence) is an ordered set of events S = {e0 , e1 , ..., ek-1 }, where for all i < j, ei < ej .
2  Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning (TIME'06) 1530-1311/06 $20.00 (c) 2006  IEEE  Obviously, |S| = k. Note that different events with the same temporal unit can belong to the same sequence.
Furthermore, the same events with different temporal unit associated can belong to the same sequence.
Nevertheless, in any case will exist two or more pairs (attribute, value) associated to the same temporal unit.
So, an attribute can not take two different values in the same instant.
3 The Sequences Base In order to obtain the basic probability assignment function (bpa function) from the frequencies of the sequences, it is necessary to calculate the number of all possible sequences belonging to the dataset.
Note that the set of frequent sequences (S fD,s,o ) only gives a partial description of the dataset since it is formed by the sequences whose support exceed a user-given threshold s. Therefore, we should determine the number of the infrequent sequences presented with the purpose of obtaining a complete description of the dataset.
So, we should calculate the number of sequences belonging to the set of infrequent sequences, that we denote D,s,o , where as S!f  Definition 5 Let Utmin be the minimal dimensional value associated to the sequence S. In other words, U tmin = min{ei .t}, for ei [?]
S. If Utmin = 0, we say that S is a normalized sequence.
Note that any non-normalized sequence can be transformed into a normalized one through a normalization function.
Let Utmax be the maximal dimensional value associated to the sequence S. This value indicates the maximum distance amongst the events belonging to the normalized sequence S. In other words, U tmax = ek .t, where |S| = k. From both, confidence and complexity points of view [9], this value will be always less than or equal to a user-defined parameter called maxspan, denoted by o.  D,s,o = {Si |support(Si ) < s} S!f  and therefore, as D,s,o S D,s,o = S!f [?]
SfD,s,o  Definition 6 The support (frequency) of a sequence is defined as: fr (S) , support(S) = |D|  it is possible to calculate the number of all possible sequences presented in the dataset just adding up the frequencies of the sequences in the global set S D,s,o .
Let  Fr (S) = fr (Si ), Si [?]
S  where fr (S) denotes the number of occurrences of the sequence S in the dataset, and |D| is the number of records in the dataset D, in other words, r.  be the function that calculates the total number of sequences presented in the set S. Obviously,  i  D,s,o Fr (S D,s,o ) = Fr (S!f ) + Fr (SfD,s,o )  Definition 7 A frequent sequence is a normalized sequence whose support is greater than or equal to a user-specified threshold called minimum support.
We denote this userdefined parameter as minsup, or simply s.  D,s,o is an incomplete set formed by the However, S!f shortest mined infrequent sequences (recall the downward closure property), and therefore, it is impossible to compute D,s,o ).
However, as we can see in the sequel, there is Fr (S!f a theoretical way to obtain the value of F r (S D,s,o ).
After D,s,o ) via obtaining this value, it is ease to calculate F r (S!f the next formula:  Given a dataset D and the user-defined parameters o and s, the goal of sequence mining is to determine in the dataset the set SfD,s,o , formed by all the frequent sequences whose support are greater than or equal to s, that is,  D,s,o ) = Fr (S D,s,o ) - Fr (SfD,s,o ) Fr (S!f  SfD,s,o = {Si |support(Si ) >= s}.
3.1 Preliminary results  This set, formed by a large number of time-stamped sequences, is the goal of the temporal data mining algorithm and the input of the method proposed in this paper for obtaining a temporal constraint network.
Basically, the idea is to obtain a global temporal model of the dataset from the discovered set of local temporal patterns.
In order to do this, we firstly need to calculate the basic probability assignment using the frequencies of the patterns, obtaining the sequences base, whose structure is presented in the next section.
This subsection contains preliminary results that are needed in the construction of the sequence base.
Based in the sort of dataset, which can be viewed as a rx c data matrix, and the combinatorial nature of the problem of mining frequent sequences, we propose a formulae for calculating the number of all possible sequences belonging to the dataset in absence of the minimum support constraint, that is, for calculating F r (S D,s,o ).

This set, the global set of o-constrained sequences belonging to the dataset D, is an incomplete set since we only know the structure of the frequent sequences.

So, we redefine S D,s,o in S!f the next definition.

The last case represents total ignorance, that is, any of the three basic relations is possible.
The representation is extended using the Possibility Theory for modeling the plausibility degree of each basic relation.
Given two temporal points, a and b, an uncertain relation r ab between them is > = represented by a normalized vector P ab = (P< ab , Pab , Pab ), > < = such that max(P< , P , P ) = 1, where P (respecab ab ab ab > tively, P= ab , Pab ) is the possibility of a < b (respectively a = b, a > b).

As, < = P<= ab = max(Pab , Pab )  In literature can be found a large amount of work trying to handle uncertainty in temporal reasoning.
However, very few work deal with time points as ontological primitives for expressing temporal elements.
Basically, two temporal point-based approaches have been recently proposed for representing and managing uncertain relations between events, the probabilistic model done by Ryabov and Puuronen [12], and the possibilistic model proposed by HadjAli, Dubois, and Prade [8].
In this paper, the authors argued the main differences between these two approaches.
Mainly, there are two main differences.
First, the possibilistic modeling can be purely qualitative, avoiding the necessity of quantifying uncertainty if information is poor.
Second, their proposal is capable of modeling ignorance in a non-biased way.
In our case, the selection of the possibilistic model is reinforced by the fact that we need a model which make the fusion of mined and expert knowledge easier [5].
The selected model is based on possibility theory [4] for the representation and management of uncertainty in temporal relations between two point-based events.
Uncertainty is represented as a vector involving three possibility values expressing the relative plausibility of the three basic relations (" < ", " = ", and " > ") that can hold between these points.
Also, they describe the inference rules thatf ormthebasisof thereasoningmethod defining a set of operations: inversion, composition, combination, and negation, the operations that govern the uncertainty propagation in the inference process.
The authors show that the whole reasoning process can actually be handled in possibilistic logic.
Three basic relations can hold between two temporal points, "before (<)", "at the same time (=)", and "after (>)".
An uncertain relation between temporal points is expressed as any possible disjunction of basic relations: <= >=  = ?
== == == ==  where Ac is the complement of A  = > P>= ab = max(Pab , Pab ) < > P= ab = max(Pab , Pab ),  we can obtain the necessity degrees of the basic relations, < = N (a < b) = 1 - P>= Nab ab = Nab = N (a = b) = 1 - P= ab > Nab = N (a > b) = 1 - P<= ab .
In a similar way, we can also obtain >= = N (a >= b) = 1 - P< Nab ab = Nab = N (a = b) = 1 - P= ab <= Nab = N (a <= b) = 1 - P> ab .
Moreover, the authors defined the rules that enable us to infer new temporal information and to propagate uncertainty in a possibilistic way.
The reasoning tool relies on four operations expressing: inversion composition combination negation  < or = > or = < or > <, =, or >  == == == ==  These rules completes the definition of a model for representing and reasoning with uncertain temporal relations that uses the Possibility Theory as an expressive tool for dealing with uncertainty in temporal reasoning.

5 Extracting Uncertain Temporal Relations  5.2 Calculating the possibility measures of temporal relations  In this section, we propose a technique for extract the uncertain temporal relation between each pair of event types from the sequences base.
The uncertain temporal relation is represented by an uncertain vector formed by three possibility values, expressing the plausibility degree for each basic temporal relation.
We propose the use of Shafer Theory of Evidence [13] to obtain the plausibility degrees from the probability masses associated with the global set of sequences.
The result will be a temporal constraint network, which is a suitable model for representing and reasoning with temporal information where uncertainty is presented.
In our proposal the core is the sequences base BS D,s,o which is formed by a set of focal elements or sequences.
Let O be the set of event types presented in the dataset, that is, O = {(A[i], v)|v [?]
dom(A[i])} .
Taking into account the maxspan constraint, the set of events is defined as an extension of the O set in this way: Oo = {(A[i], v, t)|v [?]
dom(A[i]) [?]
0 <= t <= w)} This set is our frame of discernment, that is, O o = U.
So, the set of focal elements, the sequence base, is defined:  5.1 Shafer's Theory of Evidence  BS D,s,o = {Si [?]
Oo |m(Si ) > 0} ,  The Shafer Theory of Evidence, also known as Dempster-Shafer Theory, is a theory of uncertainty developed specially for modelling complex systems.
It is based on a special fuzzy measure called belief measure.
Beliefs can be assigned to propositions to express the uncertainty associated to them being discerned.
Given a finite universal set U, the frame of discernment, the beliefs are usually computed based on a density function m : 2 U - [0, 1] called basic probability assignment (bpa):  m(A) = 1.

Since we are only interested in the basic temporal relations, Th [?]

A[?

In order to compute the possibility of a temporal relation, it is necessary to consider all focal elements, that is, all sequences which make the temporal relation possible.
m(A) represents the belief exactly committed to the set A.
If m(A) > 0, then A is called a focal element.
The set of focal elements constitute a core: F = {A [?]
U : m(A) > 0}  Proposition 4 Let suppose the qualitative temporal relation e1 The2 .
This relation induces a parameterized set:  The core and its associated bpa define a body of evidence, from where a belief function Bel : 2 U - [0, 1] is defined:  m(B) Bel(A) =  Xe1 The2 = {(ei ej )} ,  B|B[?

For any given measure Bel, a dual measure, P l : 2 U - [0, 1] can be defined: P l(A) = 1 - Bel(A).
Proposition 5 In order to obtain the set of sequences involved in the temporal relation, we introduce the assessment operator G, defined as:  So, this measure called plausibility measure, can be also defined:  m(B).

Proposition 6 The possibility degree of the temporal relation e1 The2 is defined as:  m(Si ) P(e1 The2 ) = P l(e1 The2 ) =  It can be verified [13] that the functions Bel and P l are, respectively, a possibility (or necessity) measure if and only if the focal elements form a nested or consonant set.
A weaker statement consists in establishing the equivalence when the intersection of the focal subsets are not empty.

7 Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we propose an initial approach for building temporal constraint networks from a set of mined frequent sequences with the aim of obtaining a more understandable, useful and manageable sort of knowledge.
The selected temporal model belongs to a special class of model proposedbyHadjAli, Dubois, andP rade, which uses the Possibility Theory as an expressive tool for representing and reasoning with uncertain temporal relations between point-based events.
The uncertainty is represented as a vector involving three possibility values expressing the relative plausibility of the three basic relations between two temporal points, that is, "before", "at the same time" and "after".
We propose Shafer's Theory-based technique to obtain these plausibility degrees from the calculated basic probability assignment function from the frequencies of the sequences.
In future work, we intend to analyze in depth the networks obtained from the set of mined frequent sequences.
We also propose to extend the model of temporal network in order to represent not only qualitative but also quantitative temporal relations, taking advantage of the temporal information presented in the time-stamped sequences extracted by T SET .
