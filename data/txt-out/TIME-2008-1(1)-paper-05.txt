Centre-Ville, Montreal, Canada H3C 3P8  Abstract Configuration Logic (CL) is a fragment of XQuery that allows first-order quantification over node labels.
In this paper, we study CL satisfiability and seek a deterministic decision procedure to build models of satisfiable CL formulae.
To this end, we show how to revert CL satisfiability into an equivalent CTL satisfiability problem in order to leverage existing model construction algorithms for CTL formulae.
1  Introduction  The similarity between tree languages and temporal logic has long been recognized.
Recently, fragments of XPath have been interpreted in terms of CTL [3] and Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) [2].
Complexity and decidability results on semi-structured data are revisited from a modal logic perspective in [4, 15].
Finally, correspondences between XML Schemata and multi-modal hybrid logic formulae have also been established [7].
The main interest of such connections is the "well-behaved" nature of modal logics, an observation that has also led to the development of guarded logic [5].
The satisfiability of a tree logic is an important question in a number of practical contexts [6]: database query optimization -where the unnecessary calculation of inconsistent queries can be avoided,- information leakage in security views and consistency of XML specifications.
The majority of works relating tree languages to modal logics are considered navigational: they are less flexible in stating relations between values of different tree nodes.
In contrast, Configuration Logic (CL) includes first-order quantification over node labels in addition to the usual Boolean and parent-child connectives.
In this paper, we attempt to solve the problem of CL satisfiability from a temporal logic perspective.

mantics of CL in Section 2 and show that its satisfiability is undecidable in general.
We then seek ways of "taming" the full-blown language CL.
This task is delicate, since adding even a simple hierarchical structure over the variables of a decidable first-order language is sometimes enough to render it undecidable.
Nevertheless, it can be shown that satisfiability of CL with unary predicates is complete for nondeterministic exponential time.
However, it is important to note that all previously mentioned applications assume a deterministic decision procedure for the language in question.
Therefore, from a practical point of view, we should not be content with the NEXPTIME complexity result for CL and look for a deterministic procedure.
We show in Section 3 that given a CL formula ph, there exists CTL formulae o(ph) and ps such that ph is satisfiable if and only if o(ph) [?]
ps is satisfiable.
Our construction provides a 2EXPTIME decision procedure which, under widely-held complexity theoretic assumptions, is optimal for deterministic time and restates the problem in a pure CTL setting.
2  Satisfiability of Configuration Logic  CL is a logic over tree structures whose nodes are namevalue pairs.
It has been introduced as an appropriate language to express constraints on the configuration of network routers [18].
2.1  Syntax and Semantics  A configuration is a forest of nodes, each formed of two parts: a name and a value, represented in the form "name = value".
We associate to each node of T a unique symbol that we call a number.
This symbol does not play a role in the logic properly speaking, but will be used in the decision procedure we present in Section 3.
We assume that each forest is topped with an additional source node and consider that a configuration is a tree.
The succession of name-value pairs from the source to an arbitrary node is called a named path; two nodes are considered identical if they have the same named path.
A named  path can also have one or more variables in place of the "value" part of some nodes.
In this case, depending on the values taken by those variables, the named path will designate different nodes.
Variables standing for the "name" part of nodes are not authorized.
In addition to the traditional Boolean connectives, CL allows quantification on the "value" part of "name = value" pairs.
Existential quantification takes the form hp ; n = xi ph, where p is a (possibly empty) named path, n is a name and x is a variable free in ph.
In this quantification, only x is bound; the other variables possibly occurring in p are considered free.
In line with the interpretation of CL as a tree generalization of first-order logic [19], the presence of named paths in a quantifier amounts to locating, within the hierarchy, the first-order variable to be quantified; this location can depend on previously quantified variables.
The formal semantics of CL is shown below, where T is a tree, r is a valuation, Ri is a predicate, x is a tuple of variables matching the arity of Ri , p is a (possibly empty) named path, and V is the set of node values.
Disjunction and universal quantification are derived in the classical way.

T and T, r[x/v] |= ph  Necessary Conditions for Decidability  In the following, we study the complexity of the decision problem for CL: given a formula ph with unary predicates, determining whether there exists a tree that satisfies ph.
Trakhtenbrot showed that for any first-order language with n-ary relations (n >= 2) other than equality, satisfiability for finite structures is undecidable [17].
CL being a generalization of first-order logic, this theorem also applies to it.
However, while in the case of first-order logic, restricting the signature of the language to unary relations and equality is sufficient for ensuring decidability, this condition no longer holds with CL.
Theorem 1.
There exists a CL formula ph(x, y) such that for every structure hS, Ri, where R is a binary relation over S, there exists a configuration T such that R(s1 , s2 ) = T |= ph(s1 , s2 ).
Proof.
Let T be the tree constructed with dummy name p as follows: there exists a named path p = u, p = v if and only if R(u, v) holds.
Then R(u, v) is equivalent to ph(u, v) = h ; p = xihp = x ; p = yi x = u [?]
y = v.  Using the fact that variables in CL are organized in a tree structure instead of a flat set, CL with unary relations and equality over infinite domains can simulate first-order logic with arbitrary binary relations and is therefore undecidable.
To restore decidability, assuming no restriction on the structure of formulae, CL must be restricted to unary predicates, or equivalently to equality over finite domains.
Decidability then comes as no surprise: Theorem 2.
The satisfiability problem for CL with equality is NEXPTIME-complete given fixed sets A and B of names and values.
Proof.
For the lower bound, it suffices to remark that CL with unary predicates is a generalization of monadic firstorder logic, whose satisfiability is NEXPTIME-complete [8, section 6.2.1].
For the upper bound, let ph be a CL formula using only names and values in A and B.
By the semantics of CL, the arity of trees is bounded by C = |A||B| (since no two children of the same parent can have the same "name=value" pair), and the depth of the trees is bounded by |ph| (since recursion on paths is not allowed).
The maximum size of a tree is then bounded by O(2|ph| ); by [10], model checking of a single tree of size |T | is in O(|ph| * |T ||ph| ) and the problem is in NEXPTIME.
Numerous works have considered the satisfiability of related fragments of tree languages; each of them differs from the others in the set of features they support: first-order quantification on node values, "next-sibling" relation, number and type of Boolean connectives ([?
], !, [?
]), "child" relation, recursion or transitive closure, equality between node values.
We refer the reader to [2, 11-13, 16] for complexity results on each of these fragments.
3  Satisfiability as a Temporal Logic Problem  The decision procedure presented in Theorem 2 is nondeterministic.
A straightforward determinization would consist of generating all possible finite trees in a sequence until one that satisfies the desired formula is found.
Termination is guaranteed by the fact that the number of candidates to search is finite, due to the semantics of CL with unary predicates.
In this section, CL satisfiability is rather translated into a CTL decision problem.
Since CTL is decidable in simple deterministic exponential time [9], it provides an alternate, deterministic CL decision procedure.
The advantage of using CTL decision procedures is twofold: it leverages algorithms for a well-studied logic, and the decision algorithms (especially [14]) create a model by decomposing the original formula, therefore making better "educated guesses" on the candidate model than a bruteforce enumeration.

Embedding of CL quantifiers into CTL  3.1  Reducing CL to CTL  The first part of the translation consists in converting a configuration T and a CL formula ph with n quantified variables to a Kripke structure KT,ph = (S, I, R, L), where S is a set of states, I [?]
S is a set of initial states, R [?]
S 2 is a transition relation and L is a labelling function.
Then ph is translated into a CTL formula o(ph) such that that T |=CL ph if and only if KT,ph |=CTL o(ph).
The construction we use is based on the reduction of CL model checking to CTL model checking presented in [10].
We briefly summarize this construction.
A state s [?]
S of KT,ph corresponds to a node of the original tree and a valuation of the quantified variables x1 , .
.
.
, xn of ph.
Let A, B and G be respectively the sets of all names, values and numbers appearing in T .
From these sets, we create the sets A0 , B 0 and G0 by adding to each a special, unused symbol # that will stand for "undefined".
For each state variable x, Lx : S - Dom(x) assigns a unique value to every variable in every state.
Formally, let a [?]
A0 , b [?]
B 0 , c [?]
G0 and (b1 , .
.
.
, bn ) [?]
B 0n .
Let s be a state such that La (s) = a, Lb (s) = b, Lg (s) = c and for all 1 <= i <= n, Lxi = bi .
Then s is a state in S if and only if there exists a node in T with name a, value b and number c. Hence, for each node in T , there are multiple states in KT,ph associated to it, namely one for each possible valuation of the x1 , .
.
.
, xk ; we call these the copies of T .
We extend the term and call a copy the sub-Kripke structure obtained by taking the restriction of R to S(d1 ,...,dn ) .
Variable g is then called a representative of a and b: for every d [?]
G0 , there exist values a [?]
N 0 and b [?]
V 0 such that for every state s [?]
S, Lg (s) = d implies that La (s) = a and Lb (s) = b.
The transition relation R is composed of two kinds of transitions.
Tree transitions link the states belonging to the same copy of T .
A tuple (s1 , s2 ) [?]
S 2 is a tree transition if and only if s1 and s2 belong to the same copy.
For each tree transition t = (s1 , s2 ) such that Lg (s1 ) = c1 and Lg (s2 ) = c2 and for each 1 <= i <= n, Lx1 (s1 ) = #, t [?]
R if and only if node numbered c2 is the child of node numbered c1 in T .
A transition (s1 , s2 ) [?]
R is a freeze transition if and only if there exists 1 <= j <= n such that Lxj (s1 ) 6= Lxj (s2 ) and for every 1 <= i <= n (i 6= j), Lxi (s1 ) = Lxi (s2 ).
A freeze transition (s1 , s2 ) [?]
R is resetting if and only if Lg (s2 ) = #.
Freeze transitions restrict the behaviour of variables x1 , .
.
.
, xn ; such variables are aptly called freeze variables.
A freeze variable acts as some kind of permanent "memory device": it is originally set to some undefined value, and once it takes a definite value, it keeps ("freezes") it for the remainder of the execution of the system.
A variable xi in KT,ph is a freeze variable if and only if whenever Ls (xi ) = #, for every s [?]
I, and for every (s1 , s2 ) [?]
R, either Ls1 (xi ) = # or Ls1 (xi ) = Ls2 (xi ).
A freeze variable xi is a memory of state variable b if and only if for every transition (s1 , s2 ) [?]
R, either Ls1 (xi ) = Ls2 (xi ) or Ls2 (xi ) = Ls1 (b).
Finally, since each copy in K is meant to be an image of the original tree T , we must ensure that all such images are identical with the concept of symmetry: K is symmetrical if any tree transition (s1 , s2 ) [?]
R such that Ls1 (g) = c1 and Ls2 (g) = c2 either exists in all copies or in no copy of K. No constraint is imposed yet on the actual paths that the algorithm takes on each traversal: these constraints are enforced by the translation of the CL formula into CTL.
Once the Kripke structure KT,ph is obtained, the translation function o of the CL formula ph into CTL becomes simple.
It is defined recursively on the structure of the formula; ground equality testing and Boolean connectives are translated in the traditional way; the quantifiers are translated as shown in Table 1.
Theorem 3 (from [10]).
Let T be a tree, ph be a CL formula and o be the embedding defined previously.
Let KT,ph be the Kripke structure built as described above.
Then T |=CL ph if and only if KT,ph |=CTL o(ph).
3.2  Bad Models of o(ph)  The mapping produced by o produces a CTL formula linear in the size of the original CL formula.
By the EXPTIME-completeness of CTL satisfiability and Theorem 2, providing a model of o(ph) is not sufficient to show there exists a tree T that satisfies ph unless EXPTIME = NEXPTIME.
For example, consider the unsatisfiable CL formula h ; a = x1 i [ ; a = x2 ] x1 6= x2 whose translation o(ph) is the following:  o(ph) that is a tree encoding simply amounts to finding an arbitrary model of o(ph) [?]
ps.
All the following lemmas apply to a Kripke structure K defined as in the previous section.
The first three take care of representatives and freeze variables.
Lemma 1.
State variable g is a representative if and only if the following holds for K: ^ _ AG (g = d - (a = a [?]
b = b)) (2) d[?

AG (xi = # [?]

AX xi = k)) (3) k[?

EX (x1 6= # [?]

State variable xi is a memory of state variable b if and only if the following holds for K: ^ AG ((xi = # [?]
b = k) - AX (xi 6= # - xi = k)) k[?
]B  (1) One can easily check that this CTL formula is satisfiable; Figure 1 shows a model of this formula.
However, this model is not a structure of the form KT,ph for some tree T .
We give below a property ps such that o(ph) [?]
ps is satisfiable in CTL if and only if ph is satisfiable in CL, thus giving a sufficient condition for a Kripke structure to be KT,ph for some tree T .
Moreover, we shall see that ps only depends on the number of variables in ph.
Theorem 4.
Let ph be a CL formula with n >= 1 variables, and K = (S, I, R, L) be a Kripke structure with state variables a, b, g and x1 , .

, xn that respects the following conditions: 1.
In the initial state, all state variables take value #; 2.
The graph hS, Ri is a tree; 3. g is a representative of a and b; 4.
The xi are freeze variables that memorize b; 5.
All freeze transitions are resetting; 6.
K is symmetrical.
Then K is a tree encoding: there exists a configuration tree T such that K is KT,ph .
Proof.
Due to lack of space, we only sketch the proof.
It suffices to remark that a tree T can easily be extracted from the copy of K where all xi = #.
From that tree, we build KT,ph as in Section 3.1 and observe that K = KT,ph .
3.3  Tree Encodings  (4) As for the existence of a representative, symmetry can be imposed by a CTL formula.
Special care must be taken, since "terminal" copies (where all freeze variables are initialized) do not have successors.
Lemma 4.
K is symmetrical if and only if it respects the following, with state variable g as a representative: ^  n _  d1 ,d2 [?
]G0  i=1   xi 6= # - ((AG (g = d1 - EX g = d2 ))   [?]
(AG (g = d1 - !
(EX g = d2 ))))  (5)  Lemma 5.
All freeze transitions are resetting if and only if the following holds for K with state variable g as a representative: n ^  AG ((xi = # - AX (xi 6= # - g = #))  (6)  i=1  Since the Kripke structure constructed by the CTL decision procedure can be arbitrary, it is not excluded that such structure contains cycles.
We must therefore impose two additional conditions restricting the structure to trees.
Lemma 6.
K is acyclic if and only if the following holds:  In order to infer CL's satisfiability from CTL's, we must arrange for the CTL decision procedure to return only tree encodings.
The following lemmas show that each of the conditions in Theorem 4 can actually be expressed as CTL formulae, so that the property of being a tree encoding is by itself a CTL formula ps.
Therefore, searching for a model of  ^ ^ d[?
]G0 k1 [?

]B  AG ((g = d [?]
x1 = k1 [?]
* * * [?]
xn = kn ) - !EF (g = d [?]
x1 = k1 [?]
* * * [?]
xn = kn )) (7)  Lemma 7.
If K is acyclic, then K is a tree if and only if the following holds: ^ EF (g = d1 [?]
EX g = d2 ) - d1 ,d2 [?
]G0  (AG (g 6= d1 - !EX g = d2 )) (8) The combination of Lemmas 1-7 and Theorems 3 and 4 yields the desired result.
Theorem 5.
Let ph be a CL formula with k quantified variables.
Let ph0 = o(ph) be its CTL translation.
Let ps be the conjunction of (2)-(8).
ph is satisfiable in CL if and only if ph0 [?]
ps is satisfiable in CTL.
By this theorem, a model for a CL formula can be constructed directly using decision procedures for CTL.
It should be noted that in the expression of ps, the conjunction of (2)-(8) is exponential in n. But since n <= |ph|, then |o(ph) [?]
ps| [?]
O(2|ph| ).
In turn, satisfiability for CTL is EXPTIME-complete; hence the resulting decision procedure for CL is in deterministic double exponential time.
Unless EXPTIME = NEXPTIME, this result is optimal for a deterministic CL model construction procedure.
4  Conclusion  In this paper, we have shown how to reduce the satisfiability of CL with unary predicates to the satisfiability of CTL.
This leads to a 2EXPTIME upper bound on the deterministic decision procedure.
Moreover, the reduction of CL satisfiability to CTL satisfiability, although it requires an exponential translation of the original formula, still yields a decision procedure which, under widely-held complexity theoretic assumptions, is optimal for deterministic time.
