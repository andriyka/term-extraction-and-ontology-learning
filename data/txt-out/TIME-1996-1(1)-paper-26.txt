A lamp and a switch problem Let us assume that we have a lamp with a switch.
The pushing the switch results t o turn the light on whenever the lamp is off, otherwise it causes to turn the light off.
1) The Initial Stage: We have no time structure in the initial stage of thinking.
INTRODUCTION  In this paper, we introduce a temporal logic called Interval Division Logic IDL based on the constructive temporal ontology.
In IDL, time is regarded as a constructive object which is built from an interval by iterating the interval division in the process of temporal reasoning.
Namely, whenever new (past, present or future) event is recognized in the current epistemological stage, the time structure of the next epistemological stage is formed by dividing the corresponding interval into two intervals before and after that event.
Therefore, the time structure of IDL has a form of binary tree of which leaves constitute the current sequence of intervals and the depth of tree corresponds to the level of the epistemological stage.
In this point, IDL is different from the other tree-based temporal logic such as the branching time, in which the depth of tree corresponds t o the timeline.
[l] IDL itself is a sound and complete logical system which is as expressive as the Biiich infinite tree automata.
However, it is intrinsically nonmonotonic because of its constructiveness, since it is perfectly reasonable that the beliefs in the current epistemological stage will be changed in the next epistemological stage due t o the new information.
we extend a nonmonotonic temporal reasoning in IDL in order to examine how the persistence problem is treated on this constructive ontology.
Since the persistence itself is due t o the retention of the belief rather than the inertia of real world, the interpretation for a sequence of events depends not only on the temporal order of the events  2) Event El: The lamp is observed to be on a t a time t o .
3) Event E2: The switch is pushed at time t l (to 5 tl).
4) Event E3: The lamp is observed to be on at time t2 ( t l _< t 2 ) .
Assume that these events are recognized in one of the following sequences.
1) Casel: A strict sequence: we observe E l first, then E2 secondly and E3.
2) Case2: A sequence in the backward order: we observe E3 first.
After that we are informed E2 and informed E l finally.
3) Case3: A sequence in random: we observe E2 first.
After that we are informed E l and informed E3 finally.
The problem is to find out the most preferable interpretation for each case, although we have infinitely many solutions which are logically correct if unknown S W I T C H i n g may occur at anytime.
In the casel, we believe that the lamp holds on after the first observation, so that we infer the swiching  190 0-8186-7528/96 $5.00 0 1996 IEEE  ,4subset V : V E U is called a subtree if and only  at the time t l changes the state of the lamp from on to off.
Consequently, we believe the lamp t o be off immediately before the event E3 in which we observe the lamp to be on.
Then, what time structure do we build in the mind to explain this series of events consistently after we know the event E3?
The most reasonable time structure, the solution1, is formed on the assumption that someone pushs the switch between t l and t2.
Another interpretation, the solution2, is an explanation on the assumption that the switch had been already pushed between tO and t l so that it was off before the switch was pushed a t t2.
This time structure is possible but seems to be unnatural in this case.
For the case 2, we prefer the solution2 to the solutionl on the contrary.
This difference in the preference of the solutions is based on the simple reason that we usually avoid the annoying update of the already constructed belief in the inferential process.
For the case3, both the solutionl and solution2 are preferable.
This example reveals that the temporal structure and its interpretation for a sequence of events depends not only on the temporal order but also the epistemological order in which each event is recognized.
Since the temporal reasoning is intrinsically sequential because we can not examine simaltaneously two events which occur at different time, it is an important view that the order of inference plays an essential role in the temporal reasonings.
However, this example brings about yet another frame problem because some difficulties arise in attempts to deal with this example in the usual nonmonotonic logics, even in the methods proposed to solve YSP(Ya1e Shooting Problem) [7].
In the following, we define a formal system of IDL that is essentially an intuitionistic logic of time and propose a new method of nonmonotonic temporal reasoning based on the Gabbay's intuitionistic approach.
if  (Vz)[xE v ----t ox E v] A [xo E v i f f x l E v] A maximal linearly ordered subset of the tree U is called a branch of U .
Since a branch is a decreasing sequence of intervals, it has a limitting point in (0, l}", which is implicitly corresponding to the time instant.
,4tuple T = (VI C,5 ) is called a Time Struetare.
]Definition 2.
Temporal topology ]Let x be an element of U .
A subset [z] is given by [XI =  2.i!
Temporal Ontology The elementaly object of IDL is an interval E .
All intervals are formed from E with an interval division.
Thlerefore, the new interval is added to the current time structure whenever a new event is recognized or an inconsistent interval is generated so that the refinement of time structure is required.
Two modal operators [Ol'p and [l]pare used to represent 'p to be true on z0 and z l respectively.
Time point is implicitly corresiponding t o the starting or endpoints of intervals.
Every predicate is evaluated on intervals rather than time points.
The usual modal operator OF is used to represent the proposition 'p is true in [g] (namely, it is not enough that p is true in every subinterval of the current time structure but p must be true in the all subintervals appearing in the future inferential process).
we treat two types of objects used in temporal thinking; namely, beliefs about states and events.
A state means a persisting temporal phenomena (natmely, propositional fluents in the situation calculus) and an event corresponds to an obsevation of a state or an action, which is usually instantaneous phenomenon so that it is defined at the starting or end points of intervals.
These objects are represented using two modal operators (p and )p. In general, ($ is true on a interval x if and only if there exists a subinterval y with the same starting point with x such that O$ is true on y. Similaly, )$J is true on a interval x if and only if there exists a subinterval y with the same endpoint with 2, O$ is true on y. Namely, )$ and ($ means that $ is true in the some open set of intervals of which starting (end) points is same as the current interval.

Time structure Let U be the set of all finite sequences of 0's and 1's.
Namely, U = {0,1}*.
U can be diagramed as a binary tree.
We denote the parent node of x by ox and the successor nodes of x by x0,xl.
We introduce two order relations in U .

A open set is also defined.
Namely, a set Q is open if and only if  2 TEMPORAL STRUCTURE 2.1 Time Structure The time structure of IDL is represented with a binary tree of which nodes correspond to intervals and the successor relation is the set inclusion between two ictervals.

A wff cp said to be a theorem iff I- cp is deduced from the axioms by the successive application of the inferential rules.
We introduce the deductive relation 'p t $ by: 'p t t/j if and only if t Ocp 3 U$ Note that cp is informally interpreted to be true at an interval z when Ocp holds in x.
Also 'p is true at a time point (the starting point or the end point) in interval x when (p (or )'p) holds in 2.
Therefore, the deductive relation p I- $ means that if 'p is true a t any interval z then $ is true at the interval z.
EXAMPLES: The lamp with switch nonmonotonic reasoning For each case of the examplea, the inferential process, is given in the following.
Case 1 The first event El, the observation that the lamp is on a t time t l , divides the empty interval q5 into 0 , l where (on is true in 1 .
This is immediately realized in this interval by the default rule L1 under the assumption OOon.
The next event E2, namely someone pushs the switch at time t2, urges the interval division of 1 into 10 (and 11.
Note that Don is believed to be true in 1.
Therefore, )on is true in 10.
From the causal rule of switch, we can infer (off in 11, which falsifies the default OOon in 1.
Since application of the rule2 for (on also falsifies its assumption, By the rule L3, (on in 1 is realized in 10 by the rule L3.
( o f f in 11 itself is realized by the rule L1 so that Ooff holds in 11 under the assumption nooff.
The third event E3, the obsevation that the lamp is on a t time t3 again forces the decomposition of the interval 11 into 110 and 111 where the )on to be true in 110.
From this information, the default nooff in 11 is falsified and the rule L2 is applied to (off in 11.
But this is failed because D o o f f does not hold even in 110.
Therefore] by the rule L3, [llO](off is examined.
Finally, this is realized in 1100 by the rule L2 under the assumption n u o f f in 1100.
)on in 110 is also realized in 1101 under the assumption Doon in 1101.
Case 2 The first event E 3 gives [3on(O0on)in 0 by the rule R1 and the next switching E 2 divides this interval into 00,Ol where O o f f ( o 0 o f f )in 0 and Oon(0Oon) in 1.
The third event El falsifies the default nooff in 0.
13y applying the rule R3,Rl,R2, we have a time line in which Don in 0010,ooff in 0011 and non in 11.
Consequently, we select the solution1 for the case1 andl the solution2 for the case2, respectively but there is no difference between two solutions for the case3.
Soundness, completeness and decidability The above axiom system is a sound and complete characterization for I D L .
Also cp k $ is decidable relation.
This is proved from a theorem that IDL's formula is as expressive as the Biiich infinite tree automata[4][9].
4 NON-MONOTONICITY 4.1 general default rules In order t o deal with the temporal reasoning about the persistence, we extend the IDL-based nonmonotonic logic in the framework of Gabbey's intuitioninstic theory of nonmonotonicity [5].
We introduces a default rule: A--tC(OOB) i f a n d o n l y i f A A O B t C which means we can infer C nonmonotocally from A by using a default D O B .
This default rule means that we can conclude tentatively C from the knowledge A and a belief B a t the current epistemological stage.
From the view of the model minimization, this method corresponds to prefer the model in which any default is changed as late as possible in the epistemological order only if it is necesarry.
4.2 persistence of beliefs In order t o deal with the temporal reasoning about the persistence of beliefs, we employ transform ($, )$ into the following default rules  ----  L1: ($  L2:(+  L3: (+ RI:)+ R2:($  R3: )+  $ (DO$)  4.31 Yale Shooting Problem The Yale Shooting Problem YSP is the famous example which exhibits the persistence problem can not be treated completely by the non-monotonic version of the simple temporal logic [7].
We show how this problem is dealt with in the I D L .
The problem itself is very simple.
Let assume the following event sequence.
[ O M A [11(11,(~U[OI+)  [OM ~ ~ ~ I ~ U + )  4 (W$)  PI$ A [Ol)$  (OO[ll$)  11111, ([lIOO+)  (4 originally means  +  1 In the initial situation, it is observed that a gun is unloaded (Tloaded) and Teddy is alive (alive).
that is true at the starting point of the cerrent interval, namely holds in some nei hbore of that point.
In the other words, the (+ (or!+) is true in the current interval iff O$ is true in some subinterval z with the same starting point (the same endpoint) as the interval.
In this case, we say ($ (or )$) is realized at z.
+  2 Then, the gun is loaded(L0AD).
3 Some time after that ( W A I T ) , 4.
Teddy is shooted(SHO0T)  193  in the interval 1110.
Therefore, (loaded can not be realized in 11 so that it should be realized again in 110.
The result (Figure 3-b shows that something happens to cause the gun un oaded while WAITing.
(Here we use the action WAIT following the original formulation of YSP but the same result is derived without WAIT, because the time structure in IDL is dense so that actions may occur at any time.
In the case without W A I T , the interval before S H O O T is devided and the gun is unloaded at that time.)
5.
Is Teddy alive or not?
I  In this example, the initial condition is represented by an axiom : OBL(-doaded A alive) , namely, [l](lloaded A [I](a!ive The sequence of actions is informed in the following order: [l]LOAD A [l][l]WAITA [1][1][1]SHOOT The causal laws of the actions LOAD and S N O O T are given by U LOAD [l] loaded} OlShool (jloaded A) alive) -+ [ 13(wlive]} The action W A I T has no causal law because it does not change any situation.
T[[O]  Oloaded [ 1 1 101 [ 1 I 111 O a r ive ...  At first, we observe the gun is unloaded and Teddey is alive in the initial situation.
This information divides the initial interval q5 into 0 and 1 where ( d o a d e d A (alive is true a t the interval 1.
These two (-formula are immediately realized so that D-doadedA Oalive is assumed t o be true in 1.
The action LOAD forces the division 1 into two subintervals 10 and 11.
From the causal rule for LOAD, (loaded is beleaved to be true in 11.
Therefore, D-doaded in 11 is not consistent with the action LOAD so that d loaded should be realized again in the interval 10, while Oalive is assumed to be true in the both intervals 10 and 11.
The action W A I T urges the division 11 into 110 and 111 but it does not change any situation.
The action S I I O O T divides the interval 111 into 1110 and 1111.
We can assume loaded is true in 1110 becaiisp ( l o ~ d e dis realized in 11.
By the causal rille for SIIOOT, (Talive become t o be true in the interval 1111.
This is immediately realized in this interval, so that --alive is true in the interval 1111.
As a resiilt, we construct the preference rriodel slio\vn in the Figure 3-a, which gives the prediction that teddy is dead after shootiiig, so that the IDL gives the natural answer for this problem as is similar to the other logic such as Shoham's chronological ignorance [8].
< lalive  .
*e-  IDL also gives the intuitively natural answer for the problem which requires the reasoning backward in time.
Let assume that we are inforrned that Teddy is alive for some time after shooting in the above example How the temporal structure is modified and the squences of events is explained?
The answer is simple if we can believe that Teddy can raise from the dead.
In this case, we get a modif i d model with new time-line in which Teddy is dead in the result of shooting but he is recovered again afterwards.
However, we have a knowledge that he can't be revived usually.
Namely, O(-alive Olalive) Assume that the interval 1111 is devided into 11110 and 11111 where )alive is observed a t 11110 This means that Oalive is true a t the interval 11110 from the above axiorn.
Namely, ( d i v e holds in 1111.
From the causal rule of S H O O T , j-doaded should be true -+  Figurel.
Time structure for the YSP  194  5  Concluding Remarks  [3] 'W.B.Ewald, " Intuitonistic Tense and Modal ]Logic, '' Journal of Symbolic Logic, vol.
51, 1986.
In this paper, we introduce a temporal logic which is based on an idea that time is constructed step-bystep along with the thinking process for temporal phenomena.
Although we omit the discussion here, the concept of tense is also introduced via the interval division.
For instance, FT), which means II, is true in every future interval, is equivalent to the statement that 1c, is true for every right interval of all previous interval divisions.
The tense of past can be similarly defined.
The IDL is essentialy intuitionistic, although it is formulated in the cotegory of S4 logic, so that Gabbey' intuitionistic approach to nonmonotonic reasoning is naturally incorporated.
Temporal logic is extended to the intuitonistic one for the point ontology in [3] and for the interval ontology in [2].
However, these logics are the bi-modal logics constituted from S4 x S 4 , S 4 for epistemological order and another S 4 for the temporal order, so that it is radically different from IDL.
