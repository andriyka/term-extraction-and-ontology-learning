An Efficient Algorithm for Temporal Abduction Vittorio Brusoni, Luca Console, Paolo Terenziani, Daniele Theseider Duprit Dipartimento di Informatica, Universita di Torino Corso Svizzera 185, 10149 Torino, Italy E-mail: { brusoni,Iconsole,t erenz ,dtd} @di.unit 0.it  Extended Abstract Abduction is the process of generating explanations for an observation 0, starting from a domain theory T 161.
Here we consider an extension of the "classical" definition of abduction in order to deal with temporal knowledge both in the theory and in the observations.
This form of abduction is the basis of many problem solving activities such as temporal diagnosis and reasoning about actions and events.
In the paper we assume that T is a set of explanatory formulae of the form al,.

,b, {C(t,,, .
.
.
,tan, t b l , .
.
.
,tb,)} where ai, b, are atoms and t, denotes a time interval in which a is true (an episode of a ) .
An explanatory formula of this form represents the fact that the conjunction of a maximal episode for each one of a l , .
.
.
,a, is a direct explanation of an episode of each bi, where the set of temporal constraints C(t,, , .

.

.
.
,tb,) is imposed on the temporal extents of the episodes.
Given a model T and an observation 0 (including a set CO of temporal constraints), a temporal explanation is a set E of abducibles, i.e., atoms that occur only in antecedents of formulae, such that: the observed atoms in 0 are explained by E through chains of explanatory formulae in the model T ; the set T E of temporal constraints, consisting of CO plus the constraints associated with the explanatory formulae involved in the explanation, is consistent.
tion also produces the minimal network, which is a compact representation of all the solutions to the set of constraints, consisting of the strictest constraints between all the variables [4].
In [3] we proved the following locality property concerning STP constraints: given a minimal network T C N K on a set K of variables, checking whether a set of constraints T C N A on a set A of variables is consistent with TCNK can be done in time cubic in the number of variables in A (regardless of the number of variables in K ) , by propagating the constraints in T C N K and T C N A only on the variables in A (local propagation on A ) .
Moreover, the temporal constraints on -4obtained by the local propagation are the me (the strictest ones) that would be obtained by global propagation on all the variables in K U A.
In this paper, we show how this locality property can be used in order to compute temporal explanations efficiently.
In fact, they could be computed using first an abductive reasoner as a generator of candidates and then a temporal reasoner for checking the consistency of each candidate.
However, pruning temporally inconsistent candidate explanations as soon as possible during the generation process provides great, focusing and computational advantages.
One way to achieve such a goal is to perform, at each abductive step, global temporal constraint propagation on all the variables in the candidate being built (as, e.g., in [ 5 ] ) .
In the following we show how, thanks to the locality property, local temporal propagation can be used to prune efficiently temporally inconsistent candidates, obtaining the same pruning results that would be obtained by global propagation, both in case of singly connected and of non-singly connected explanation graphs.
In our approach, the temporal constraints are expressed in terms of conjunctions of bounds on differences constraints between variables (called STP constraints in [4]and in the following).
Different types of temporal constraints (e.g., continuous pointizable qualitative relations [8], precise or imprecise absolute temporal locations and durations, delays) can be represented using the STP framework [2], which is expressive enough for most applications [7].
The consistency of a set of STP constraints on a set K of variables can be checked in time cubic in the number of temporal variables in K .
This computa-  Case (a).
Consider the case where different observations (or different atoms in the antecedent of a formula) are explained with independent assumptions, so that the explanation is singly connected (as in Fig-  28  0-8186-7937-9197$10.00 @ 1997 IEEE  tion to each Nk; 2. forward visit from N , to NI with local propagation to each Nk; 3.local propagation to N , which ensures (after steps 1 and 2) that the strictest constraints on dl , .

.
.
, M 3 , as in step 1.
5.forward visit of M 3 , .

.
,Ad1,as in step 2.
Thus, in general, if the explanation graph is singly connected, a backward visit followed by a forward visit of each branch is sufficient to detect temporal inconsistencies, if any, as they would be detected with global propagation to all the visited atoms.
Case (b).
Let us consider now the case of a non-singly connected explanation, as in Figure 1, including the dashed N ' , corresponding to:  E3 x, ,... x,  NZ  Y 1,  ...Y n  Nl  Figure 1: Two chains of explanatory formulae.
For example, N I corresponds to the formula: F1 : y1,.

It is possible to compute such strictest constraints if all the local propagations performed during the forward visit of N,, .
.
.
, N and the backward visit of M I , .
.
.
, M3 also involve the atoms which "join" the two chains (e.g., w1,.
.
.wh,ul,.. .
a p ) ;these atoms must be taken into account for the local propagations until T I , .
.. ,rUcan be reached again, after which they can be disregarded.
Moreover, some further optimization is possible of the set of "junction" atoms.
We developed an explanathi dgorithm which follows the strategy discussed above, so that it uses local propagations only, and detects a temporal inconsistency if and only if it would be detected using global propagation (instead of local propagation).
In particular, given a model T and an observation 0, we compute an explanation by means of a depth-first backward nondeterministic search: the abducible atoms forming the explanation are searched starting from the atoms in 0 and applying the formulae in T backwards.
Temporal consistency is checked whenever a new formula is selected.
For the sake of efficiency, the algorithm assumes that there is at most one maximal episode of each atom a, and that T is acyclic.
We now analyze the overhead on the computation of one explanation due to temporal constraint propa-  ure 1, without the dashed N ' , where w1.

Let us first consider the chain of explanatory formulae N , N I , .
.
.
,Ni.
Suppose that the minimal network for N containing (besides the others) the atoms z1 .
.
,zm has been computed, and Fl is selected in order to explain some of the atoms in z1,.. .
,zm.
The current explanation graph and temporal constraints must be extended using Fl and its constraints C1.
The locality property guarantees that local propagation to N1 produces a minimal network for the variables in N I only, such that the constraints in it are the same that would be obtained by (global) propagation to N U N I .
This allows us to localize constraint propagation to the atoms in a formula F when USing F in an explanation step.
This principle can be iteratively applied to the chain Nl, .
.
.
,N , in figure 1: given the minimal network for NI (produced by local propagation), the minimal network for N2 can be computed with local propagation to the atoms in N2, and so on.
When the abducible atoms w1 .
.
.wh are reached, such a set of local propagations guarantees that the temporal constraints on such atoms are the strictest ones that would be obtained with global propagation, Thus, we have that inconsistencies are detected by local propagation when they would be detected with global propagation.
Since now N is no longer a minimal network (only the constraints between w1,.
.
.
,Wh are now minimal), before moving to explaining dl , .
.
.
, d,, the minimal constraints between them must be computed.
We can thus proceed as follows: 1. backward visit from N I to Ni with local propaga-  29  100%75%  -  50%  -  25%  ziani.

We consider the case where a solution is found without search, i.e., without backtracking on the nondeterministic choices.
In case of search, we have similar advantages also on the failed branches.
In particular, wc compare: 0 the algorithm based on global propagation approach (called ALGglobal in the following), which checks the temporal consistency by means of global propagation whenever a new formula is selected 0 our algorithm (augmented with some optimizations for dealing with multiply connected graphs), which follows the stategy discussed above and performs local temporal propagations (ALGIoCaI).
The algorithms have been implemented in C and Prolog; in particular, as regards the management of temporal information, we used LATER[l],an efficient manager of temporal information exploiting the locality property of STP mentioned above.
Figure 2 reports the ratio between the computation time for the two algorithms, as a function of the number of atoms in the explanation, in case of highly multiply connected explanations.
An analitycal evaluation of the time complexity of our approach shows that, although in the worst case the asymptotic complexity of our algorithm is the same as the global propagation one (i.e., the overhead on explanation is quartic in the number of nodes), in practice we have a significant improvement.
Moreover, in case the theory plus the observations form a singly connected graph, we have also an improvement in the asymptotic complexity, since, in such a case, the local propagation algorithm adds a linear overhead.
This is a further significant advantage of our approach wrt the global propagation one which is not sensitive to the topology.
