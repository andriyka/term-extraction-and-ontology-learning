Extending Topological Nexttime Logic Bernhard Heinemann Fachbereich Informatik, FernUniversitaEt Hagen Da58084 Hagen, Germany Bernhard.Heinemann@fernuni-hagen.de  Abstract Subsequently, we provide an extension of topological nexttime logic, see [10], by an operator expressing increasing of sets.
The resulting formalism enables one to reason about the change of sets in the course of (discrete) linear time.
We establish completeness and decidability of the new system, and we determine its complexity.
As to the latter, we obtain a alowa upper complexity bound of the corresponding satisfiability problem: NP; this is due to the fact that the time operators involved in our logic are comparatively weak.
It is intended that the system is applicable to diverse fields of temporal reasoning.

Introduction In this paper we are concerned with the change of sets in the course of time.
This seems to be a rather general approach since changing sets actually occur in many fields of computer science and AI.
Let us mention two different topics.
First, consider a multiaagent system and an agent involved in it, for instance a processor in a distributed system; see [5], [8].
The set of states representing the knowledge of the agent changes during a run of the system.
Thus, in order to specify the behaviour of such a system one should have at oneas disposal a tool dealing with changing sets (of this particular kind) formally.
The language we introduce below in fact originates from this context, and a knowledge operator is retained in it.
However, its semantics differs from that of the common logic of knowledge considerably.
The second topic is spatioatemporal modelling and reasoning which currently represents a very active branch of research.
It is one of the major goals of the efforts undertaken in this field to express adequately and handle formally the growing and shrinking, respectively, of various objects, and the temporal change of geometric shapes in particular.
In fact, the purpose of the present paper is to provide a simple general framework subsuming dynamics of sets of  0-7695-0756-5/00 $10.00 AL 2000 IEEE  the kind indicated by these examples.
To this end we consider a certain system admitting topological reasoning, which has been proposed in [2]; let us just call it TR.
According to the definition of its semantics the system TR captures shrinking of sets at least, offering access to our topic thus; moreover, it is related to the logic of knowledge.
This system serves as our starting point presently.
One should notice, however, that there are different formalisms of computational logic dealing with dynamic aspects of sets, but having other objectives; see [3] and [9], for instance.
We mention the very basic features of TR, for convenience of the reader.
The system is derived from modal logic.
(We presuppose the fundamentals of modal and temporal logic in this paper; they can be found in [1] or in [7], e.g.)
Confining oneself to the singleaagent case there are two modalities included in TR: the first, designated K , quantifies ahorizontallya over the elements of a set, and the second, 2, quantifies averticallya over certain of its subsets expressing ashrinkinga in this way.
The two modalities also interact (and their duals respectively).
This interaction depends on the class of the semantical structures to be examined.
It is a demanding question in general to describe the interplay of K and  axiomatically.
Several classes of set spaces, i.e., pairs (X; O) such that X is a nonaempty set and O is a distinguished set of subsets of X , have been treated on the basis of the just indicated logical language up to now, topological spaces in particular.
(Notice that certain connections have already been discovered between topology and modal logic many years ago; see [14].
Quite recently, they have been utilized for qualitative spatial reasoning in AI; see [15].)
This and further examples have been worked out in [2] and [6].
In view of what follows let us mention a particular variation of TR where shrinking of sets proceeds in discrete steps.
The resulting system can therefore be viewed as a generalization of propositional linear time temporal logic; see [10] and [11] for a closer examination.
In this paper we deal with the growth of sets additionally.
It is our idea to modify the 2aoperator of the logic  n lg a` a b defghijljige gl  Figure 1.
A discretely changing set  of set spaces appropriately so that the just mentioned temporal meaning is achieved.
In order to guarantee that this works the expressiveness of 2 has to be reduced in a sense.
Actually, 2 will be substituted by two nextstep operators corresponding to growing and shrinking respectively.
By that it is in fact possible to express modally a dynamic change of sets of the kind depicted in Figure 1.
One can, for instance, describe the development of knowledge of an agent in this way, where phases of alearninga are followed by those of aforgettinga and vice versa.
Systems regarding each of these properties separately have been examined from an implementationaoriented point of view in [4].
Note, however, that possible worlds outside the knowledge state of the agent are not considered; so, we can only speak of a description afrom the agentas point of viewa.
The outline of the paper is as follows.
We define the basic logical language in Section 2.
Afterwards, in Section 3, we introduce the system and prove its semantical completeness.
In Section 4 we prove that the set of all theorems of the system is decidable.
Moreover, we show that the corresponding satisfiability problem is NPacomplete.
We omit many details in this extended abstract, especially routine arguments in proofs like structural inductions; those concerning the fragment of shrinking sets can be found in [10].

Prerequisites In this section we introduce a language designated CS.
With the aid of CS one can speak about the change of sets in the course of time.
First we determine the syntax of CS.
Starting out with a suitable alphabet and a recursive set of propositional variables, PV, we let the set F of CSaformulas be defined as the smallest set of strings satisfying   PV  F  ;  2 F =) : ; K; g; s; ( ^ ) 2 F .
The single step operator g corresponds to growing of sets and the operator s to their shrinking; furthermore, K is intended to move inside sets.
We omit brackets and use abbreviations as usual; further-  0-7695-0756-5/00 $10.00 AL 2000 IEEE  more, we let  L : :K : ; g  : : g : ; and s  : : s : ; for all  2 F .
The idea to define the semantics of CS is as follows.
We would like to express the change of a given set, Y .
Since the set may grow or shrink in the course of time, certain subsets and supersets of Y have to be considered in the formal model.
Thus we take a universe, X , in which all these sets are contained, and the system of these sets, O, as the basic components of the domains by means of which we give meaning to formulas.
But O is structured by phases of growing and shrinking respectively.
This is captured by a suitable segmentation of O; i.e., a partition such that on every segment the sets either descend or ascend.
Finally, we want to assign a truth value with respect to alocusa and atimea to all propositions, by means of a valuation .
Consequently, we consider certain triples (X; (O )2J ; ) as the relevant semantical structures in essence, where J is a set indexing a partition of O.
Actually we choose J to be an initial segment of N, and we let O be indexed in the same way.
For any set X we let P (X) denote the powerset of X .
Definition 2.1 1.
Let I be an initial segment of N. A subset I 0  I is called connected, iff there is no j 2 I n I 0 strictly between any two elements of I 0 .
A partition of I into connected subsets is called a segmentation of I .
2.
Let X be a nonaempty set, and  I  an initial segment of  N  f : I ;!
P (X) n ; a mapping.
Furthermore, let I 0 be a connected subset of I .
Then f is called increasing on I 0 , iff i  j () f(i)  f(j) holds for all i; j 2 I 0 ; and decreasing on I 0 , iff i  j () f(i)  f(j) holds for all i; j 2 I 0 :  3.
Let X , I and f be as above.
Moreover, let  I := (Ikck )k2J be a segmentation of I , where J is a suitable initial segment of N and ck 2 fg; sg for all k 2 J .
(The letter g indicates agrowinga, and the letter s ashrinkinga.)
Then f is called faithful on I , iff for all k 2 J  f is increasing on Ikck ; if ck = g; and f is decreasing on Ikck ; if ck = s:  4.
Let X , I , I  = (Ikck )k2J and f be as in 3.
(a) The pair S := (X; f) is called a set frame (corresponding with I ), iff f is faithful on I .
[ Ig := fIkck j ck = gg;  (b) Let  [ Is := fIkck j ck = sg:  and let  (Note that these sets form a disjoint union of I .)
(c) We denote the range of f by O or by  fUi j i 2 I g occasionally.
5.
Let S  := (X; f) be a set frame, I the domain of f , and  : PV  X  I ;!
f0; 1g  a mapping which is defined exactly for the triples (A; x; i) such that x 2 f(i).
Then  is called a valuation, and the triple M := (X; f; ) is called a model (based on S ).
This definition formalizes the change of sets along the lines of TR.
Now we define the validity relation between formulas and soacalled situations of set frames, which are simply pairs x; Ui (designated without brackets mostly) such that x 2 Ui 2 O (i 2 I ).
The set component Ui of a situation qualitatively measures the actual adegree of closenessa to x.
Definition 2.2 Let a model M = (X; f; ) and a situation x; Ui of the underlying set frame (X; f) be given.
Then we let  x; Ui j=M A x; Ui j=M :   : () (A; x; i) = 1 : () x; Ui j6 =M   x; Ui j=M  and x; Ui j=M  ^  : () x; Ui j=M   y; Ui j=M  x; Ui j=M K : () for all y 2 U i  i + 1 2 Ig and x; Ui j=M g  : () x; Ui+1 j=M  8 < i + 1 2 Is ; x; Ui j=M s  : () : x 2 Ui+1 and x; Ui+1 j=M ;  for all A 2 PV and ;   2 F.  0-7695-0756-5/00 $10.00 AL 2000 IEEE  In case x; Ui j=M  is valid we say that  holds in M at the situation x; U i ; moreover, we say that the formula  2 F holds in M (denoted by j=M ), iff it holds in M at every situation.
Note that a formula g  can only hold a given situation of some model, if the actual time point lies in a agrowing phasea and is not its endpoint, or is immediately followed by such a phase; an analogous statement holds for s .
For convenience of the reader we also present the semantics of the duals of the single step operators:  8 < i + 1 2 Ig =) x; Ui j=M g  : () : x; U j=M  i +1 8 < i + 1 2 Is ^ x 2 Ui+1 x; Ui j=M s  : () : =) x; Ui+1 j=M :  3.
The Logic First in this section we present a list of axioms holding in every model.
Adding approriate rules gives a logical system then.
Later on we prove that the given axiomatization is complete with respect to models based on set frames.
To this end we will show that every formula that is not derivable in the system can be falsified at some situation of some model.
We divide the axioms into four groups.
The first one only consists of a single scheme embedding propositional logic in the present framework.
(P) All F ainstances of propositional tautologies.
The next group concerns those axioms involving the modality K alone.
They are wellaknown from the logic of knowledge of a single agent; see [5].
Presently they stipulate quantification inside sets.
Let ;  2 F be formulas.
(K1) (K2) (K3) (K4)  K( ! )

Let c 2 fg; sg.

(c  !
c )  c  !
c   Subsequently those axioms are listed which reflect the interaction of the different modal operators.
(I 1)  L g  !

L s  K s ( !
L) _ K s ( !
L) K g  _ K s   for all A 2 PV and s 2 C .
The subsequent truth lemma is wellaknown.
In modal logic some of these schemes determine certain properties of the accessibility relations of the frames in which they are valid; e.g., (K2) corresponds with reflexivity in this sense, (K3) with transitivity, (K4) with weak symmetry1 , and (C2c) with partial functionality.
While the scheme (I 4) of the last group in particular implies exclusion of simultaneous growing and shrinking, the first three axioms of this group are in accordance with certain requirements on the composition of the corresponding accessibility relations on the canonical model of the logical system which we are going to introduce now.
This system is obtained by adding four derivation rules to the axioms, which read   !
;    K  ;  Proposition 3.1 All of the above axioms hold in every model, and the rules preserve validity.
2  We are going to show next how completeness of the system C with respect to the class of models based on set frames can be proved.
f of C. This is We start out with the canonical model M formed in the usual way (see [7], x5); i.e., the domain C of f consists of all maximal Caconsistent sets of formulas, M and the accessibility relations induced by the modal operators K and c (c 2 fg; sg) are defined as follows:  L t : () f 2 F j K 2 sg  t s ;!
c t : () f 2 F j   2 sg  t; s ;!
c for all s; t 2 C .
Finally, the distinguished valuation of the canonical model is defined by  (A; s) = 1 : () A 2 s; A binary relation R on a set X fulfills this property by definition, iff s R t and s R u implies t R u, for all s; t; u 2 X .
0-7695-0756-5/00 $10.00 AL 2000 IEEE  (b)  f j= [s] iff  2 s, and M f j=  iff  .
M  The next lemma is commonly known as well.
The axiom schemes (K2) a (K4) are responsible for (a), whereas (C2c) is used to establish (b) (c 2 fg; sg).
L  Lemma 3.3 (a) The relation ;!
is an equivalence relation on the set C .
c  (b) For each c 2 fg; sg, the relation ;!
is a partial function on C .
Proposition 3.4 Let s; t; u 2 C be given.
for all c 2 fg; sg and ;  2 F .
As usual they are called modus ponens, K anecessitation and c anecessitation respectively.
Let us call the resulting system C. Soundness of C with respect to the intended structures can easily be established.
1 Also called the euclidean property, in [7] (p. 12) for instance.
(a)  We now utilize the schemes (I 1) and (I 2).
c  Proof.
Straightforward.
Lemma 3.2 Let us denote the usual satisfaction relation of multimodal logic by j=, and let  designate Caderivability.
Then, for all  2 F and s 2 C , it holds that  L  g  (a) Assume that s ;!

u holds.
Then there exists a point v 2 C satisfying  g L s ;!

Then there exists a point v 2 C satisfying  s u: L v ;!

Proof.
We only prove (a) because the proof of (b) proceeds analogously.
We consider the following set of formulas  S := f 2 F j g  2 sg [ fL 2 F j  2 ug; and we assume towards a contradiction that this set is inconsistent.
Then some finite subset  f1; : : :; n; L1 ; : : :; Lm g of S is inconsistent as well.
Using standard techniques from modal proof theory we first get   L !

g: : Now we apply wellaknown properties of maximal consistent sets: Because of the maximality of u,  is contained in u.
Thus, according to  Proof.
See [10], Proposition 3.5.
Let us also define a corresponding relation g on C .
g L t ;!
s ;!
u;  the formula L g  is a member of s. We conclude that g:  2 s holds, too.
But this contradicts g  2 s. Consequently, our assumption is false; i.e., the above considered set S is consistent.
Therefore S is contained in some maximal Caconsistent set v. The point v 2 C fulfills the desired property.
2  Following a common manner of speaking (in [2], e.g.)
the assertion of (b) is called the cross property.
Accordingly, let us call the assertion of (a) the modified cross property.
With the aid of the preceding proposition we immediately get the following corollary.
Corollary 3.5 Let a natural number s1 ; : : :; sn; t 2 C be given.
n > 1  and points  (a) Assume that  g g g L s ;!

Then there are s02 ; : : :; s0n 2 C satisfying  [s] g [t] : ()  L s0 ;!

i  for i = 1; : : :; n ; 1.
Next we examine the part that axiom (I 3) plays.
Let [s] L denote the ;!
aequivalence class of s 2 C .
Define the following binary relation s on the set  C := f[s] j s 2 C g  L  of all ;!aequivalence classes:  [s] s [t] : () for all [s]; [t] functional.

a Although the cross property and the for all [s]; [t] 2 C modified cross property look completely symmetrical, their effect on the canonical model concerning the development L of ;!
aequivalence classes with respect to s and g , respectively, is different.
In fact, in order to obtain the analogue of Proposition 3.6 with respect to g axiom (I 1) is already sufficient.

Consequently, the assumption is false; i.e., the assertion of the proposition is valid.
2  As a consequence of this proposition we get that even  g s t and s ;!
s ;!
t cannot hold simultaneously.
Corollary 3.9 Let s; t 2 C be given.
Then  s t =) s ;!

Proof.
Otherwise we would also have [s] s [t] and [s] [t], by the definition of s and g respectively.
g  2  Now we are in a position to define a model M falsifying a given nonaderivable formula  2 F .
For this purpose we first choose a maximal aconsistent set s 2 C containing : .
Let l designate the lafold iteration of the relation g [ s , for every l 2 N. For all k 2 N and points t 2 C such that [s ] k [t] consider the function  C  ftk  : It ;!
C  which is inductively defined on a suitable initial segment It of N by  ftk (0) := t  8 t0 2 C > > > > < k ft (n + 1) := > > > > :  satisfying  c t0; if ftk (n) ;!
ftk (n); c 2 fg; sg; and t0 exist,  undefined  otherwise,  for all n 2 N; ftk is welladefined because of Lemma 3.3 (b) and Corollary 3.9.
Taking advantage of Proposition 3.6 and Proposition 3.7 the following statement can be proved by an induction argument.
Proposition 3.10 Let t; t0 2 C and k; k 0 2 N. Assume that 0 for some j 2 N both ftk (j) and ftk0 (j) are defined.
Then  L f k0 (j) is valid.

Define    k 2 N; t 2 S; [s ] k [t];   : X := ftk j and f k is maximal t  The set X will be the carrier of M. In order to define O let I be the one initial segment of the natural numbers having  m := maxf1; maxfk + card(It ) ; 1 j ftk 2 X g  0-7695-0756-5/00 $10.00 AL 2000 IEEE  Ui := fftk 2 X j k  i and ftk (i) existsg; for all i 2 I .

Thus  := (X; f) is  It remains to define a valuation on S .
This is done by  (A; ftk ; i) = 1 : () A 2 ftk (i); for all A 2 PV, ftk 2 X and i 2 I such that ftk (i) exists.
The following truth lemma is crucial.
Lemma 3.12 Let X , f and  be as above.
Define M := (X; f; ).
Then, for all  2 F , ftk 2 X and k  i 2 I such that ftk (i) exists, we have ftk ; Ui j=M  ()  2 ftk (i): Proof.
By induction on the structure of  ; the interesting case  = K needs Corollary 3.5 and Proposition 3.10,  2  among other things.
Letting  = : , t = s , and desired completeness result.
i = 0, we obtain the  Theorem 3.13 Every formula that is not derivable in the system C can be falsified at some situation of some model based on a certain set frame.
Combining Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 3.13 we get: Corollary 3.14 A formula holds in every model.
2 F  is Caderivable, iff it  4.
Decidability and Complexity Starting out from the above completeness proof decidability of our logic can be obtained rather easily now.
In fact, the logical system C satisfies the finite model property in the sense that every nonaderivable formula  2 F can be refuted in some finite model of the axioms.
The reason for this fact is the bounded ascopea of a formula holding at some situation of a given model.
Let a formula  , a model M = (X; f; ), a point x 2 X , and a natural number i 2 N be given such that x; Ui j=M  .
Without loss of generality we may assume that i = 0 holds additionally.
Let r() be the arank of  , i.e., the degree of nesting the caoperators in  (c 2 fg; sg).
Finally, let M0 be the structure obtained from M by restricting f to the initial segment  Proof.
Due to the definition of , the valuation  is wella defined.
Everything else is more or less obvious.
of its domain (hence acuttinga the image of f after the initial segment of length r()), letting the carrier X be unaltered, and restricting the valuation  appropriately.
Then the following coincidence lemma is valid, which can be proved by a structural induction.
Let us call a formula  2 F satisfiable, iff it holds at some situation of some model.
Lemma 4.1 and Lemma 4.2 show that a satisfiable formula can always be realized in a aflata finite model, in which the chain of distinguished subsets is short.
Unfortunately the model is possibly too abroada at the same time.
We are going to show that we can guarantee satisfaction even in a aslendera model if the given formula is satisfiable at all.
f0; : : :; r()g  Lemma 4.1 For all subformulas  of  , natural numbers i such that 0  i  r(), and points x 2 X , we have that if r()  r() ; i, then  x; Ui j=M0  iff x; Ui j=M : Now let  2 F be not derivable in C. According to Theorem 3.13 and Lemma 4.1 which is applied to  = : , the formula  fails at some situation of a model  M0 = (X; f 0 ; 0) such that f 0 has finite domain If 0 , thus finite image, too, which we designate O.
Taking advantage of the following equivalence relation on X a finite model can be obtained, falsifying  as well:  8 for all i 2 I 0 ; U 2 O and f i > < A 2 PV occurring in  : x  y : () > x 2 Ui iff y 2 Ui ; and > : (A; x; i) = (A; y; i): In fact, the new model M consists of the set of all a equivalence classes x of x 2 X , the induced set  O = f(Ui ) j i 2 If 0 g inherits the linear structure from O, and the valuation is given by   (A; x ; i) = 1 : () 9y 2 x : (A; y; i) = 1; for all A 2 PV, x 2 X and i 2 If 0 such that x 2 f 0 (i).
According to the following lemma the validity of subformulas of  is preserved by passing from M0 to M .
Lemma 4.2  M is a model.
Moreover, for all subformulas   of , natural numbers i 2 If 0 , and points x 2 X , we have x; Ui j=M0  iff x; (Ui ) j=M :  0-7695-0756-5/00 $10.00 AL 2000 IEEE  2  Consequently, it suffices to consider finite models based on set spaces in order to refute a given nonaderivable formula.
This gives decidability in a wellaknown manner.
Theorem 4.3 The set of formulas derivable in C is decidable.
Proposition 4.4 Let  2 F be satisfiable.
Then there exists f = (X; e f;~ ~ ) such that a model M   r()  length() is an upper bound of the size of Xe ,  r() is an upper bound of the size of the domain of f~, and  f at some situation.
  holds in M Proof.
We start with the finite model of  that has been obtained in the decidability proof and call it M = (X; f; ) presently.
We thus have x; U0 j=M  for some x 2 X and U0 = f(0).
Let I be the domain of f and I = (Ikck )k2J be the segmentation of I which (X; f) corresponds with.
For every k 2 J let ik be the minimal element of Ikck if ck = g, and the maximal one if ck = s. Choose some yk 2 f(ik ) for each k 2 J , and let       i 2 I ; K a subformula k Lk := (i; K) j of ; and y ; U 6j= K : k i For all k 2 J and j = (i; K) 2 Lk choose a point xj 2 X such that xj ; Ui 6j=  .

2  In the present paper we have examined a modal logic describing the change of sets in the course of time.
Here achangea means growing and shrinking respectively, neither alteration in shape nor in quantity, and atimea proceeds in single steps.
We have proposed a sound and complete axiomatization of the set S of formulas which are valid in all models based on set spaces.
Such set spaces precisely represent our intended semantical structures.
Furthermore, we have shown decidability of S and determined the complexity of the associated satisfiability problem.
The latter is complete in NP, thus no worse than the corresponding problem of the standard modal system S5 [13], linear tense logics [16], and topological nexttime logic [10] (and, clearly, propositional logic).
This is essentially due to the weakness of the temporal connectives.
It is very desirable to get a corresponding system with more expressive operators speaking about time.
However, this seems to be difficult.
Only restricting to a single property, shrinking or growing, yields satisfactory results; as to increasing sets, see [12] for instance.
On the other hand, a generalization of our approach to the case of more than one K aoperator is obvious; however, the complexity assertion 4.5 is clearly no longer valid then.
Acknowledgement I would like to thank the anonymous referees for several valuable suggestions how to improve the paper.
Moreover, they pointed out further possibilities to extend the previous work; this has been appreciated very much as well.
