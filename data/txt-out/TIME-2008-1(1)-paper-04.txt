Moving Spaces Ivo Duntsch, Michael Winter* Department of Computer Science Brock University St. Catharines, ON, Canada Abstract Boolean contact algebras constitute a convenient approach to a region based theory of space.
In this paper we want to extend this approach to regions moving in time - called timed contact structures.
We study their canonical models using topological spaces.
As the main contribution we prove a general representation theorem for this kind of algebras.
1.
Introduction The origins of mereotopology go back to the works of [11] on mereology and, on the other hand, the works of [9], [12], and [16] who used regions instead of points as the basic entity of geometry.
In this "pointless geometry", points are now second order definable as sets of regions, similar to the representation of Boolean algebras, where elements can be recovered as ultrafilters.
Whitehead's addition to the mereological structures of Lesniewski (which were, basically, complete Boolean algebras B without a smallest element) was a "connection" (or "contact") relation C among nonempty regions, which, in its simplest form is a reflexive and symmetric relation satisfying an additional extensionality axiom.
Historically, standard (models for) mereotopological structures were collections of regular closed (or regular open) sets of topological spaces hX, t i with the standard (Whiteheadian) contact among regions defined by uCv == u [?]
v 6= [?].
The primary example is the collection of all nonempty regular closed sets of the Euclidean plane.
The most simple algebraic counterpart of mereotopology are contact algebras, appearing in different papers under * Both authors gratefully acknowledge support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.
various names (see for instance [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15]) which are Boolean algebras extended with the contact relation C satisfying some axioms.
The elements of the Boolean algebra symbolize regions while the contact relation C corresponds to the additional topological aspect.
In this paper we want to extend this approach to regions moving in time.
We model those regions by a collection of snapshots.
First, we fix a structure of static regions, i.e.
the static world.
Given a set of points in time T a moving region is just a function from T to the static world.
In other words, a region is described by a collection of static regions at any point in time t - its (spatial) extent at time t. We want to illustrate this idea by two examples.
Notice that not all regions may be 'visible' at any given time; this situation is modelled by the fact that such a region is not in contact with anything, including itself, at that point in time.
Example 1.
We choose the Euclidean plane as static world and the set R>=0 of the non-negative real numbers as the model of time.
Now, a moving region is a function from R>=0 to the regular closed sets of the plane.
For example, r is the region so that r(x) is the closed disc with radius 1 at the point (x, x).
This region starts at the origin and moves along the diagonal without changing its shape.
Another example is the region s where s(x) is the closed disc at the origin with radius x.
This region starts as the empty region and grows constantly bigger.
It does not move at all.
Example 2.
The second example is finite.
Consider the set X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} with a contact structure based an the following picture a d  b e  c f  i.e.
a is in contact with b and d, b is in contact with a, c and e etc.
We say that two subsets A, B of X are in contact (in symbols: ACB) iff there is an a [?]
A and an b [?]
B which are in contact.
This structure - the powerset P(X) of X together with the relation C - establishes a (finite) Boolean contact algebra (cf.
next section).
P(X) serves as the static  world in our example.
Time will also be discrete, and we choose T = {0, 1, 2, 3}.
Similar to the previous example a moving region is a function from T to P(X).
For example, r defined by  P1.
([?]a)[([?
]b)aCb = aCa]; Any contact relation is a pre-contact relation.
Notice that the range of C distributes over + for any (pre-) contact relation, i.e.
r(0) = {b}, r(1) = {a}, r(2) = {d}, r(3) = {e} is the region that starts at b and moves to e via a and d. Also in this example it is possible for regions to grow or shrink.

by C2-4  s(0) = {b}, s(1) = {b, c}, s(2) = {c}, s(3) = [?]
Lemma 1 Let C be a pre-contact relation on a Boolean algebra B.
Then, the relation ~ on B defined by  starts at b grows to {b, c} and finally disappears.
a ~ b : == C(a4b) = [?
],  2.
Boolean Contact Algebras  is a congruence relation, and the relation C/~ on B/~ defined by [a](C/~ )[b] : == aCb,  For any set X and Y [?]
X we denote by X - Y the complement of Y in X.
If X is clear from the context we simply write -Y .
For a binary relation R on D, and x [?]
D, we let R(x) = {y : xRy}, the range of x with respect to R.  is a contact relation.
If ~ is an equivalence relation on a set A, we will denote the equivalence class of an element a [?]
A by [a], i.e.
[a] = {x [?]
A | a ~ x}.
Proof.
Clearly, ~ is reflexive and symmetric.
Let a ~ b and b ~ c. Then, by definition we have C(a * b* ) = C(a* * b) = C(b * c* ) = C(b* * c) = [?].
2.1.
Contact Relations  We have to show C(a4c) = C(a * c* ) [?]
C(a* * c) = [?].
Now,  Throughout this paper, (B, 0, 1, +, *, *) be a Boolean algebra; if no confusion can arise we sometimes denote algebras by their base set.
C(a * c* ) = C(a * c* * b + a * c* * b* ) = C(a * c* * b) [?]
C(a * c* * b* ) [?]
C(c* * b) [?]
C(a * b* ) = [?].
In the remainder we will also use the symmetric difference a4b := a * b* + a* * b of two elements a and b.
A binary relation C on a Boolean algebra B is called a contact relation (CR) if it satisfies:  see above C3  The second case is analogous.
Since a4b = a* 4b* , ~ preserves complementation.
If a ~ b and a0 ~ b0 , then  C0.

The pair hB, Ci is called a Boolean Contact Algebra (BCA).
see above C3  = [?].
The other follows analogously so that ~ preserves meet.
Finally, C(0) = [?]
by C0, and, hence, ~ is a Boolean congruence.
Axioms C0 and C1 imply that 0 is the only element with C(0) = [?
], i.e.
that is not connected to any element.
We are interested in a weakening of this property.
Therefore, we call a relation C on a Boolean algebra B a pre-contact relation if it satisfies C0,C2-4 and  To show that C/~ is well-defined we assume that a ~ b and aCc.
We conclude C(a4b) = [?
], which is equivalent 2  to C(a * b* ) = [?]
and C(a* * b) = [?].
Now, C(a) = C(a * b + a * b* ) = C(a * b) [?]
C(a * b* ) = C(a * b) [?]

It is a well known fact that RC(X) is a Boolean algebra with respect to the following operations and constants: 0 = [?

see above C(a * b* ) = [?]
C3  RC(X) naturally provides a contact relation C defined by aCb if and only if a [?]
b 6= [?].
C is called the standard (or Whiteheadean) contact relation on RC(X).
shows that c [?]
C(b), and, hence, bCc.
A topological space is called semi-regular if it has a basis of regular closed sets.
It is called compact if for every nonempty set {A T i | i [?]
I} of closed sets the following property holds: If Aj 6= [?]
for every finite subset J of I, then j[?
]J T Ai 6= [?].
C0,2-4: These properties follow immediately from the definition of C/~ and the corresponding property of C. C1: Let [a] 6= [0], i.e.
C(a) 6= [?].
By P1 we conclude aCa, and, hence [a](C/~ )[a].
$?
i[?
]I  Notice that the congruence relation ~ is not the same as the relation given by C(x) = C(y).
Even though the ideal of all elements equivalent to 0 is the same for both relations, the latter is not necessarily a congruence.
In Example 2 ~ is the identity, whereas C({b, e}) = {a, b, c, d, e, f } = C({a, b, c, d, e, f }).
In addition, C({a}) [?]
C({c}) = {b} but C({a} [?]
{c}) = [?].
Notice that all BCA's are representable in certain topological spaces.
The following theorem can be found in [4, 6].
Theorem 1 Let hB, Ci be a BCA.
Then there is a compact and semi-regular T0 space hX, t i and a (Boolean) embedding h : B - RC(X) with aCb if and only if h(a) [?]
h(b) 6= [?].
Every BCA hB, Ci corresponds exactly to a relational structure on the dual space hUlt(B), t, RC i of B, where RC is a closed, reflexive and symmetric relation [8].
We call RC the dual relation of C, and they are related by the following property:  3.
Timed Contact Structures A timed contact structure is given by a set modelling time, a Boolean algebra of regions and a ternary contact relation.

T .
2.2.
Topological models First we recall some notions from topology.
By a topological space (X, t ) we mean a set X provided with a family t of subsets, called open sets, which contains the empty set and the whole set X, and is closed with respect to arbitrary unions and finite intersections.
A subset a [?]
X is called closed if it is the complement of an open set.
The property aCt b indicates that the regions a and b are in contact at time t. Notice that the family of pre-contact relations could be replacedSby a ternary relation C [?]
T x B x B defined by C= {t} x Ct .
t[?
]T  In every topological space one can define the following operations on subsets a [?]
X:  A suitable definition of a family of pre-contact relations is obvious in both example.
The regions r and s from Example 1 are always in contact, i.e.
rCt s for all t [?]
R>=0 .
For the regions r and s from Example 2 we just have rC0 s and rC1 s.  S 1.
Int(a) = {o [?]
t | o [?]
a} (the interior of a), i.e., the union of all open sets contained in a. T 2.
Cl(a) = {c is closed | a [?]
c} (the closure of a), i.e., the intersection of all closed sets containing a.  Lemma 1 shows that for all t [?]
T there is a quotient BCA hBt , Ct /~t i of B.
Notice that the quotients need not be isomorphic.
Each algebra describes the static world at time t. Given an element a [?]
B we will denote the derived element in the quotient Bt by at .
Cl and Int are interdefinable, i.e.
Cl(a) = -Int(-a) and Int(a) = -Cl(-a).
The equivalence relation ~t is, in general, not the identity.
For example, the region s from Example 2 is at t = 3 equivalent to the empty region, i.e.
s ~3 [?].
A subset a of X is called regular closed if Cl(Int(a)) = a.
We denote by RC(X) the family of regular closed sets of 3  3.1.
Topological models  Theorem 3 Let hBi , Ci ii[?
]I be a family of BCAs, B be the free product of the Bi 's and ei : Bi - B the canonical embedding of Bi in B.
Then there is a contact relation C on B so that aCi b if and only if ei (a)Cei (b) for all i [?]
I.
The spatial component is given by a topological space hX, t i with the Whitheadean contact C w .
A region in time now is a function f : T - RC(X), i.e.
a function providing the spatial extent of the region for every point in time.
Proof.
In this Qproof we will Q identify the two sets Q ( Ult(Bi )) x ( Ult(Bi )) and (Ult(Bi ) x Ult(Bi )).

RC is obviously reflexive and symmetric.
Furthermore, RC is closed since it is a product of closed sets.
This shows that RC is the dual of a contact relation C on the free product B.  f Ct g : == f (t) [?]
g(t) 6= [?].
Notice that for each t [?]
T the relation Ct is defined by the standard contact relation on B, i.e.
f Ct g if and only if f (t)C w g(t).
Recall that the embedding ei is Q defined as the dual of the projection pi from the product Ult(Bi ) to Ult(Bi ).
It  Lemma 2 XT is a Boolean algebra.
Proof.
This follows immediately from the fact that RC(X) is a Boolean algebra and the component-wise definition of the Boolean operators in XT .

Theorem 2 hT, XT , (Ct )t[?

C0: We have f (t)[?

f (t) [?]

F we conclude F [?]

This implies that pi (F ) [?]

pi (F ).
Analogously, we get b [?]
pi (G).
From the definition of RC and F RC G we conclude pi (F )Ri pi (G).
Together we obtain aCi b.  C3: Assume f Ct g and g <= h. Then we have f (t)[?

and g(t) [?]
h(t).
This implies f (t) [?]
h(t) 6= [?

Then we have [?]

(g + h)(t) = f (t) [?]

By fixing a t [?]
T we obtain a BCA hBt , Ct i on equivalence classes of B.
As already mentioned in Section 3 different Bt 's need not to be isomorphic.
We will use the free product of Boolean algebras in order to embed all Bt 's in a common structure.
In the following we will apply the previous theorem to the quotients hBt , Ct i of a timed contact structure hT, B, Ci.
Let (Bi )i[?

The dual space of the free product B is given by theQproduct of the dual space of the Bi 's [10], i.e.
it is the set Ult(Bi ) with the product topology.

By Lemma 1 the quotients hBt , Ct i are BCA's.
From Theorem 3 we obtain a contact relation on the free product B of the Bt 's.
B can be represented by a compact and semi-regular T0 space hX, t i and a (Boolean) embedding h : B - RC(X) using Theorem 1.
Now, define k : B - XT by  [4] Duntsch, I. MacCaull W. Vakarelov D. and Winter M.(2006) Topological Representation of Contact Lattices.

In concrete timed contact structures regions are arbitrary functions from the time domain into the regions of the static world.
Therefore, such a region need not move 'smoothly' through the world.
In future work we will investigate additional axioms related to certain continuity properties with respect to movement.
