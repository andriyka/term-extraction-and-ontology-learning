These relations are mutually exhaustive and pairwise disjoint.
Ambiguous temporal relations are expressed by using sets of basic relations in which relations are separated by a vertical bar, I, which can be read as or.
Ladkin [7] refers to these relations as the convex relations.
In Allen and Hayes [3], all of these relations are shown to be definable in terms of the meets relation.
In addition, the temporal logic is shown to be reducible to five axioms defining the logical properties of meets.
Abstract  In this paper, we describe a new system of relations for reasoning about general, i.e., both convex and nonconvex, intervals of time.
This system is essentially an integration of Allen's theory [I,21 and a one-dimensional version of the Region Connection Calculus [6,91 of Randall, Cui and Cohn.
When dealing solely with convex intervals, this system reduces to Allen's set of relations.
Fundamental to the definition of our system is the concept of convexity with respect to an interval, an extension of the concept of convexity.

The Region Connection Calculus 1.
Introduction  The Region Connection Calculus (RCC) [6,9] is a widely used theory of spatial reasoning based on the merestopological calculus of Clarke [4,5].
Analogously to Allen's temporal ontology, RCC takes regions (as opposed to points) of space as primitive.
The eight basic spatial relations of RCC are:  On of the most widely used systems for temporal reasoning is the interval-based theory of Allen [1,2].
Allen's theory is clear and easy to use, but it is restricted to convex intervals, i.e., intervals composed of a single stretch of time with no gaps.
In this paper, we describe an extension of Allen's theory which allows us to reason about general intervals, i.e., both convex and nonconvex temporal intervals.
This extension is accomplished primarily through the use of the concept of convexity with  (1) region x is externally connected (ec) to region y.
(2) region x is disconnected (dc) from region y.
(3) region x partially overlaps (po) region y.
(4) region x is a tangential proper part (tpp) of region y.
(5) the inverse of tpp.
(6) region x is a nontangential proper part (ntpp) of region y.
(7) the inverse of ntpp.
(8) region x is equal (eq) to region y.  respect to an interval.
The general outline of this paper is as follows: in the next section, we introduce Allen's system and in the following section we discuss the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) [6,9].
We then integrate a onedimensional version of RCC with Allen's theory to produce a new theory of temporal reasoning with general intervals.
We then describe how this new theory can cover intersections, sums and differences of general intervals.
and we briefly compare this system to those of Ladkin [7] and Ligozat [8].
Finally, we illustrate the utility of our system with some examples.
These relations are mutually exhaustive and pairwise disjoint.
There are seven additional relations which, together with the basic relations, form an is-a lattice.
These can be defined in terms of the basic relations as follows: connected (c,,) =&f tpp I ntpp I q I tppi I ntppi I po I ec (not to be confused with Allen's contains) part (p) 'def tpp 1 ntpp 1 eq properpar( (PP) =def tPP 1 ntpp ovedaps (a& =&f tpp I ntpp I eq I tppi I ntppi I po  2.
Allen's System There are thirteen basic relations between convex intervals of time in Allen's theory: before (b), after (a), meets (m), met-by (mi), during (d), contains (c), starts (s), started-by (si), finishes (0, finished-by (fi), equals (eq),  O-7695-0173-7/99 $10.00 0 1999 IEEE  8  (generalized overlaps, not to be confused with Allen's strict overlaps) discrete (dr) =&f dc I ec inverse of part (pi) =&f tppi 1 ntppi 1 eq inverse of p?-opf?rpa??

First, however, we need to define the extended version of before: (1) x b y =tidcf VtlJ2.
comp(t1, x) A comp(t2, y) + tl b t2 Convexity of temporal intervals can now be defined as follows: interval x is convex iff  4.
An Integration of Allen's System and RCC  vtlJ.2.
(tl c X) A (t.2 G X) A (tl b t2)  If we restrict our attention to one-dimensional regions, RCC can be understood as a system for temporal representation and reasoning.
As such, it has some severe shortcomings of course, such as the inability to distinguish between before and after, but it has the advantage of not being restricted to convex intervals.
In the general case, time intervals can be understood as unions of maximal convex subintervals [7] (called components), so that  + [Vt3.

We can generalize this definition to the notion of convexity with respect to an interval as follows: interval x is convex with respect to interval y iff vtl$?.

(tl b t3) A (t3 b t2) A (t3 c y) + (t3 c x)]  Vx, tlJ.2.
comp(t1, x) A comp(t.2, x) -+ tl b I a t2  If x is convex means that x has no gaps with respect to the time line, then x is convex with respect to y means that x has no gaps with respect to y.
For example, let x be the interval below with two components using parentheses and let y be the interval with two components using square brackets.
Then, x is convex-wit y but y is not convex-wit x.  where comp(t, x) means that t is a component of x.
Understood as a system for temporal representation and reasoning, the relations of RCC can be defined in terms of Allen's relations as follows: (1) x dry = VtlJ2.
comp(t1, x) A comp(t2, y) + tl blalmlmi t2 (2) x ec y = (x dry) A 3tl,t2.

We can now redefine the rest of Allen's relations to apply to general intervals as follows: (2)xa y=,yb x (3) x m y =at 3tlJ2.

In order to expand the definitions of Allen's relations to cover general intervals, we need to look more closely  9  (10) x fi y =dd y f x (11) x 0 y =k,t (x po y) A mutually-convex(x, y) A 3t.

They are forms of dc, ec, po, pp and ppi, respectively, which apply solely to intervals which are not mutually convex and which are therefore "intermingled' to some extent.
This is the reason for the "i" prefix.
Combined with others of RCC's relations, these eighteen basic relations form the is-a lattice shown in Figure 1.
Conspicuously absent from this set of relations is any version of tpp or ntpp.
Distinguishing between these two relations would split during into two relations.
Thus while our system is an extension of Allen's system, it is not an extension of RCC.
The complete transitive closure table for the set of eighteen basic relations is given in Tables l-3 at the end of this paper.
In these tables and in the rest of the paper, the primes have been dropped from the relation names; unless stated otherwise, it is always the extended versions of the relations which are intended.
The primed relations are the new, extended versions while the unprimed relations are the original versions.
These extended convex relations are pairwise disjoint but not mutually exhaustive.
This is because intervals which are not mutually convex cannot be related using these relations.
In order to have a set of basic relations which are mutually exhaustive and pairwise disjoint, we need to add the following five new relations: (14) x idc y sdd (x dc y) A 1(x b y) A 1(x a y) (15)xiecy=k,(xecy)r\l(xm y)~+xmi y) (16)xipoy=~,(xpoy)~~(xo y)A+xoi y) (17) x ipp y =kt (x pp y) A 1(x s y) A 1(x f y) A 1(x d Y ) (18) x ippi y =d,r y ipp x  "  vu  " I  s  f  d  iPP  Figure 1.

Some Extensions to the Theory In this section, we describe some extensions to the theory as presented so far, starting with extensions to finite intersections, sums and differences of intervals, and then giving some rules for inferring convexity.
The intersection of two general intervals (tl n t.2) is defined iff tl dlclslsilflfiloloileqlipolipplippi t2.
The relations between intersections and their argument intervals are given by the following rules: (1) tl dlslfleqlipp t2 + (tl n t2) eq tl (2) t1 filo t2 + (tl n t2) f t1 (3) tl c t2 + (tl n t2) d tl (4) tl siloi t2 -+ (tl n t2) s tl (5) tl ipo t2 -+ (tl n t2) dlslflipp tl (6) tl ippi t2 + (tl n t2) ippi tl (7) (tl Rl t2 -+ (tl n t2) R2 tl) + (tl Rl-1 t2 -+ (tl n t2) RZ W)  6.
Ladkin's Theory Ladkin [7] describes a set of approximately thirty relations for reasoning about general intervals.
In his examples, he is primarily concerned with reasoning about the relationships between periodic events.
Ladkin's relations are a heterogeneous group produced by introducing functors, e.g.,mostly, always and sometimes, that generate nonconvex relations from convex relations, by producing new subclassifications of relations that aren't there in the convex case, and by enumerating relations that are based on the first and last components of the intervals.
While some of Ladkin's relations cannot be reproduced in our system, many of them can be expressed in terms of our relations in combination with the convex closures of the intervals.
The convex closure of a general interval is the minimal convex interval which has that interval as a subinterval.
An example of one of his relations is:  The union or sum or join of two general intervals (tl u t2) is defined for all pairs of intervals.
The relations between sums and their argument intervals are given by the following rules: (1) tl clsilfileqlippi t2 -+ (tl u t2) eq tl (2) tl almilfloi t2 -+ (tl u t2) fi tl (3) tl d t2 + (tl u t2) c tl (4) tl blmlslo t2 + (tl u t2) si tl (5) tl idclieclipo t2 + (tl u t2) clippi tl (6) tl ipp t2 4 (tl u t2) ippi tl (7) (tl Rl t2 + (tl u t2) R2 tl) + (tl Rl-' t2 + (tl u t.2) R2 t2)  i disjointly-contains j iff i and j have no common subobjects, and some subobject of i precedes all subobjects of j and some subobject of i follows all subobjects of j.
The difference of two general intervals (tl - W) is defined iff tl blalmlmiIclsilfiloloilidclieclipolippi t2.
The relations between differences and their argument intervals are given by the following rules:  This relation can be expressed in terms of our relations as follows:  (1) tl blalmlmilidcliec t2 -_) (tl - t2) eq tl (2) tl c t2 -+ (tl - t2) ipp tl (3) tl siloi t2 + (tl - t2) f tl (4) t1 filo t2 + (t1 - t2) s tl (5) tl ipo t2 + (tl - t2) ipplslfld tl (6) tl ippi t2 + (tl - t2) ippld tl (7) if R equals b or a or m or mi or idc or iec then tl R t2 + (tl - t2) R t2 (8) tl clipolippi t2 -_j (tl - t2) iec t2 (9) tl siloi t2 + (tl - t2) mi t2 (10) tl file t2 + (tl - t2) m t2  x disjointly-contains y = (x idcliec y) A (convex-closure(x) c convex-closure(y))  7.
Ligozat's Theory In the approach of Ligozat [83, general intervals are represented by sequences of the endpoints of their convex components.
(This system can also include isolated time points as components, but this possibility will be ignored in this discussion.)
Therefore the q-interval y = (y,, .

y,) defines a partition of time into 2q+ 1 zones, numbered 0 to 2q, as follows:  Rules involving assertions of convexity/nonconvexity:  zone 0 is {tcy,); zone 1 is y,;  (1) tl dlslfleq t2 A -convex(U) + Iconvex(t2)  11  relationships holding between the components of one interval and the components of another.
Example 2: "There was an eight-hour meeting which started at 9:00 a.m. and ended at 7:oO p.m.
The first part of the meeting was occupied with a discussion of temporal reasoning and the remainder of the meeting was occupied with a discussion of spatial reasoning."
In this example, we know that the meeting occupies a nonconvex interval, but we do not know how many components it has.
We also know that the discussion of temporal reasoning starts the meeting and the discussion of spatial reasoning finishes the meeting, but we don't know of either of these intervals whether it is convex or nonconvex.
However, we do know that the sum of these intervals equals the time of the meeting.
This caye could be represented as:  zone 2 is (y,<tcy,); ... zone 2q is (Uy,).
A relation between a p-interval x and a q-interval y is represented by a sequence of integers giving the zone of y occupied by each of the p endpoints of x.
This is equivalent to having each component of x related to each component of y by one of Allen's relations.
This system is capable of representing any possible relation between two general intervals.
Consequently this system is far more fine-grained than Ladkin's theory or the theory described in this paper.
However, in this straightforward form, Ligozat's system has two (related) problems: (1) it is too fine-grained for many purposes and (2) it requires complete information about the intervals being related.

Examples  A  A  Example 1: "There was an eight-hour meeting which started at 9:00 a.m. and ended at 7:00 p.m.
There were two one-hour breaks, one at 12:00 and the other at 4:O0.
For the first six hours of the meeting we discussed temporal reasoning and for the last two hours we discussed spatial reasoning."
There are three relevant events in this example: a meeting occupying an interval with three convex components, a discussion of temporal reasoning occupying an interval with two components, and a discussion of spatial reasoning occupying a convex interval.
The special feature of this example is that we know exactly the makeup of all of its intervals and all of the relationships between the components of these intervals.
We can represent this example as follows:  A  A  A  A A  A  A  The reason that t5 is before or meets t6 is that we don't know whether there was a break in the meeting between these two discussions.
Example 3: "There was a meeting, part of which was a discussion of temporal reasoning and part of which was a discussion of spatial reasoning."
In this case, we have no idea how many components any of the relevant intervals has, nor do we know much about the relationships between the two discussions or between the discussions and the overall meeting.
This case can be represented as follows:  time(meeting, tl) A duration(t1) = S-hours A lconvex(t1) A start-time(convex-closure(tl), 9:OOam) A end-time(convex-closure(tl), 7:OOpm) A comp(t2, t 1) A comp(t3, tl) A comp(t4, t 1) A t2 b t3 A t3 b t4 time(temporal-discussion, t2ut3) duration(t2ut3) = 6-hours lconvex(t2ut3) start-time(convex-closure(t2ut3), 9:OOam) end-time(convex-closure(t2ut3), 4:OOpm) A comp(t2, t2ut3) A comp(t3, t2ut3) time(spatial-discussion, t4) duration(t1) = 2-hours convex(t4) A (t2Ut3) b t4 A (t2Ut3) S tl A t4 f tl  time(meeting, t7) time(temporal-discussion, t8) time(spatial-discussion, ts) t8 slfldlipp t7 t9 slfldlipp t7 t8 mlmilieclblalidc t9 A  A A  A  A  A  9.
Conclusions  A A  In this paper, we have introduced a new system of relations for reasoning about general temporal intervals.
This set of relations is a direct extension of Allen's original relations and when dealing solely with convex intervals it reduces to Allen's system.
We showed how this system can reason about intersections, sums and differences of intervals, and we briefly compared it to the theories of Ladkin [7] and Ligozat [S].
We believe that a major advantage of our theory relative to these others is its simplicity and conciseness.
Currently, we are implementing this system in CLIPS, a forward-chaining, rule-based programming language.
