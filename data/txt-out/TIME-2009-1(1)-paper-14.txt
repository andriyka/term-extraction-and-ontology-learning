of Information Engineering Padova via Gradenigo, 6 - 35131 Padova (Italy) marco.falda@unipd.it *  Abstract In this paper we study the problem of representing different forms of imperfect temporal knowledge.
Imperfection in knowledge can be present in the forms of coarse knowledge about temporal events or even in the form of incomplete, imprecise, vague or uncertain temporal information.
The two orthogonal notions of coarseness and fuzziness seem to be quite adequate to manage these two kinds of temporal ignorance and they can be combined to develop a more general model.
The first part of the present study is dedicated to the definition of a new Neighborhood Temporal Qualitative Algebra nQA starting from Freksa's work about Allen's Algebra neighborhood relations.
Freksa's Algebra is merged with the Convex Point Algebra and all the neighborhood relations needed to close the nQA Algebra are computed automatically.
The Algebra nQA is tractable.
In the second part of the paper, the fuzziness notion is considered and combined with that of conceptual neighborhood.
The algebra nQAf uz is defined as a fuzzy extension of the algebra nQA, and the conditions of its tractability are studied.
1  Introduction  According to Smets [22, 23] imperfection in knowledge, and hence in temporal knowledge, may assume many aspects.
It may be in the form of incomplete information when the value of a variable is missing; it may be also due to vagueness and/or imprecision when the value of a variable is given but not with the precision required or the value is given in a coarse way.
Another aspect can be related to the presence of uncertainty: in this case it depends on the state of knowledge of an agent about the world.
All these aspects can be present and can be combined.
The distinctions between these categories are vague, as well.
Coarse knowledge is a special form of incomplete  corresponding author  knowledge.
The missing knowledge corresponds to fine distinctions which are not made.
When knowledge about temporal events is coarse, it does not appear adequate to represent it in terms of disjunctions of finely grained alternative propositions: the alternatives can lie in the same ballpark of a conceptualization, they are "conceptual neighbors" introduced by Freksa in 1992 [8].
They allow processing coarse knowledge directly with a good advantage from a cognitive point of view.
To model imprecise and vague temporal knowledge the theory of Fuzzy Sets seems to be a more natural method: it characterizes the concepts in terms of fuzzy possibility distributions [27].
It allows to relate the qualitative linguistic terms to a quantitative interpretation, providing in this way a sort of interface between the qualitative and the quantitative levels of descriptions [10].
Moreover, it has been proven [6] that fuzzy methodologies are also adequate to represent the uncertain aspect that can affect knowledge.
In this paper, we study how to deal with these two orthogonal notions of coarseness and fuzziness in order to develop a more general way to represent imperfect temporal knowledge.
To this aim, the previous points of view have been merged together: the neighborhoods represent the "horizontal" dimension [9] connecting cooperating and competing concepts, while the fuzzy membership values are the "vertical" dimension which connects the concepts with their definitions.
After having introduced classical algebras used in Temporal Reasoning (Section 2), namely Allen's Interval Algebra and Convex Point Algebra, in Section 3 the neighborhood relations of the Temporal Qualitative Algebra (i.e.
their union) are identified starting from Freksa's Interval Algebra neighborhood relations.
A new Neighborhoods Qualitative Algebra nQA is defined.
In the same section we discuss about tractability of nQA.
Then, following the vertical dimension, we extend the nQA algebra using the notion of fuzziness: membership degrees are added to the nQA  relations defining a new nQAf uz algebra.
Applying the metholodology of a-cut, already exploited in [3], the conditions of its tractability are studied.

Temporal Qualitative Reasoning is typically realized in form of calculi over sets of relations, for example over the 13 Allen's relations [1] for reasoning about intervals (that constitute the Allen's Interval Algebra IA) or over the set {<, >, =} to reason about points (Point Algebra P A, [25]).
Indeterminacy in these calculi is usually expressed by means of disjunctions of atomic relations, and so a general relation can be written as {rel 1 , .
.
.
, rel m } where each rel i is an atomic relation.
It is worth noting here that expressing indeterminacy by means of disjunctions is little plausible from a cognitive point of view, since as indeterminacy grows, complexity of the relations increases as well, while in common life vague definitions are indeed used to avoid complex definitions of ill-known entities.
When the entities involved are both points and intervals, a set P I defined by Meiri [16] can be used.
It is formed by 5 atomic point-interval relations b, s, d, f , a which stand for before, starts, during, finishes and after respectively.
The union of IA algebra with P I and P A algebras is called the temporal Qualitative Algebra (QA).
2.1  Definition 2.
A set of relations between pairs of events forms a (conceptual) neighborhood if its elements are pathconnected through "conceptual neighbor" relations.
Definition 3.
Incomplete knowledge about relations is called coarse knowledge if the corresponding disjunction of at least two relations forms a conceptual neighborhood.
Freksa has identified 18 neighborhoods relations, reported in Table 1; two of these, {b, m} = pr and {a, mi} = sd, do not appear in Allen's composition table, therefore just 29 entries (13 atomic relations + (18 - 2) Freksa's relations) are sufficient to form an algebra, in the following also referred as Freksa's Algebra (F A).
Neighborhood relations  In many cases qualitative descriptions with indeterminate reference value work because potential reference candidates provide a neighborhood of similar values or, in terms of the terminology of Qualitative Reasoning, the values form a conceptual neighborhood [8].
To this aim Freksa proposes a generalization of Allen's algebra based on semiintervals (beginning or ending of an event).
This allows restricting Allen's algebra in a more plausible way, from a cognitive point of view: the less it is known, the simpler representation can be used, in contrast with disjunctions, that complicate the representation in case of uncertain knowledge.
From the same paper the following definitions are reported:  2.2  Tractability  A frequent issue in Qualitative Reasoning is to identify subsets of relations that lead to model tractable problems, that is problems that can be solved in polynomial time and therefore can be of practical use.
Allen's polynomial time algorithm for Temporal Reasoning never infers invalid consequences from a set of assertions, but it does not guarantee that all the inferences that follow from the assertions are generated; thus the algorithm is incomplete.
Vilain and Kautz [25] have in fact shown that computing the closure in the full interval algebra is an N P-complete problem (which only can be solved in exponential time).
For this reason, sub-algebras have been developed to restrict the complexity  Definition 1.
Two relations between pairs of events are (conceptual) neighbors, if they can be directly transformed into one another by continuously deforming (i.e.
shortening, lengthening, moving) the events in a topological sense.

of the full Interval Algebra.
Noekel [18] discusses a significant subset of Allen's algebra which has a tractable closure algorithm.
This subset is defined by a convexity property and means that for any two interval end points belonging to a common semi-interval relation, intermediate end points belong to the relation as well.
By this method, the continuous uncertainty property [24] generates the set of "convex interval relations" on the structure defined by the neighborhood of the relations (Figure 1 shows the type "A" structure).
82 of these neighborhoods are convex relations in this structure and form a tractable algebra, called SAc .
Recall that P A is tractable.
Figure 2. relations between the algebras cited in the paper (the empty set is not considered a relation to be counted).
Notice that nP A is equivalent to P Ac , in the sense that both contain relations that can be mapped into one another by semantic equivalences.
Coarse relations of P A are intuitive, in fact they are also more commonly named as "less or equal to" (<=) and "greater or equal to" (>=).
Definition 5.
The inverse of pr relation is sd relation, and vice versa.
When defining such fragments, it is important to ensure that they are actually (sub-)algebras, namely closed under the operations of inversion, intersection and composition, i.e.
that by applying these operations on relations belonging to a fragment relations in the same fragment are obtained.
This ensures the applicability of constraint propagation algorithms to problems modeled by relations based on these sub-algebras.
The maximal tractable sub-algebra of IA is the ORD-Horn Algebra H identified by Nebel [17].
3  Proposition 6. nP A is an algebra closed under the operations of inversion, intersection and composition.
Now it is possible to merge nP A point algebra with Freksa's interval algebra through a set of point-interval (P I) relations and discover which additional relations are needed for defining a set of coarse relations for QA; this new set will be named nP I.
The new P I coarse relations have been computed automatically by imposing the closure of the canonical operations (i.e.
: intersection and composition) using two algorithms implemented in Prolog, one for each operation.
The pseudo-code of the algorithm for composition, the most complex among the two, has been reported in the listing named Algorithm 1; it uses a knowledge base composed by atomic and known coarse relations expressed by the predicate relations(N ), which identifies the set of relations starting from a name (e.g.
: relations(pr) = {b, m}).
From the composition table of QA atomic relations [16], all combinations can be checked by exploiting the following property of relation algebras [5]:  Neighborhoods of the Qualitative Algebra  In this Section the neighborhoods of the Qualitative Algebra QA will be studied.
To do this, the neighborhoods of all the algebras belonging to QA, that will be called nP A, nP I and nIA have to be investigated.
In Figure 2 a general schema with all these algebras is shown.
In analogy with Freksa's Algebra F A, coarse relations based on the Point Algebra P A can be defined.
Here just the convex P A, that is P Ac = P A\{6=}, will be considered.
This novel algebra, called nP A is defined as follows:  Proposition 7.
Given two relations R = {r1 , .
.
.
, rn } and S = {s1 , .
.
.
, sm }, the composition between R and S is R * S = {r1 * s1 , .
.
.
, rn * sm }.
Definition 4. nP A is the algebra formed by the set {<, > , =, pr, sd, ?}
where pr = {<, =} and sd = {>, =}.

The inverse relations of nb, na, bd, db, pr, sd, ct, bc, yc are the relations na, nb, db, bd, sd, pr, ct, yc, bc respectively.

Six additional relations for intervals have been characterized by composition (Table 3); pr and sd relations, which were not needed to close F A, are now required too.
The algorithm for intersection applied to the intervalinterval relations finds 45 additional coarse relations (Table 4) that complete the algebra of relations between intervals.
It has to be noticed that the final set of relations obtained in this way is formed by 82 relations, which can be mapped to SAc , by semantic equivalences.
/* this function returns the set of atomic relations R corresponding to the name N */ function relations(N ) return R : r(R) = N  Definition 10. nIA is the set of qualitative temporal relations given by union of the 13 Allen's atomic relations, the 18 Freksa's coarse relations, the set of 6 coarse relations listed in Table 3 and the set of 45 coarse relations listed in Table 4.

The inverse relations of pr, sd, nyo, nol, nsv, nsb, na, nb are the relations sd, pr, nol, nyo, nsb, nsv, nb, na respectively.
4  The inverse relations of the 45 relations reported in Table 4 can be obtained by inverting the relations involved.
Example 12.
The inverse of the relation sb nyo nb is the relation sv nol na.
The union of nP A with the new sets of coarse relations allows combining Freksa's coarse interval-interval relations with points: the new algebra will be called nQA.

Proposition 14.
The set nQA is closed under inversion, intersection and composition, i.e.
it is an algebra.
The algebra nQA is tractable.
Proof.
The Algebra nQA is, by definition, the union of nIA, nP I and nP A, therefore any relation belonging to nQA belongs to one of that three sets.
nIA is tractable, because it is equivalent to SAc , nP A is tractable because it is equivalent to the Convex Point Algebra P Ac , nP I is a subset of the tractable set VH defined by Jonsson and Krokhin [13] proposed to integrate punctual events in the Nebel's ORD-Horn Algebra [17].
The previous proposition can be also proven by noting that nQA is a subset of the 18th tractable algebra found by Jonsson and Krokhin in [13].

Given a set F defined over a referential set U , its characteristic function khF : U - {0, 1} has been generalized into a so-called membership function uF : U - [0, 1].
The membership degree of x [?]
F is represented by uF (x).
It is possible to assign preference degrees by means of membership functions to the classical qualitative algebras.
4.1  Fuzzy Interval Algebra and Fuzzy Qualitative Algebra  Allen's Interval Algebra has been extended to the framework of Possibility Theory by several authors ([7, 12, 19, 4, 21]).
Here, the approach proposed in [4] is considered: a degree ai [?]
[0, 1] has been attached to every atomic relation rel i .
It indicates the preference degree of the corresponding assignment among the others I1 R I2 with R = (rel 1 [a1 ], .
.
.
, rel 13 [a13 ]) where ai is the preference degree of rel i (i = 1, .
.
.
, 13).
5  In this framework, called IAf uz , different types of temporal constraints can be represented e.g.
soft constraints, that allow expressing preferences among solutions, prioritized constraints, where the priority indicates how essential it is that a constraint be satisfied, or uncertain constraints.
Meiri's Qualitative Algebra has been extended to the fuzzy case in a similar way in [2]; this extension is called QAf uz .
4.2  Figure 3. problematic hypothetical nQAf uz relation  Tractable Fuzzy Algebras  The tractable fragments of the classical QA identified in [14] can be extended to the fuzzy case exploiting the fact that in fuzzy theory a property holds if it is valid for each a-cut [26], whose definition is:  Definition 16. nQAf uz is a set of fuzzy relations {Rf uz : [?

Definition 15.
Given a fuzzy set defined by the membership function over a generic domain D u : D1 x .
.

[0, 1], the a-cut of Rf uz is the crisp set Ra = {d [?]
D1 x .
.
.
x Dk : u(d) >= a}.
Definition 17. nIAf uz the subset of nQAf uz involving interval-interval relations.
nIAf uz is semantically equivalent to the SAfc uz algebra defined in [4], the only difference is that inferences in the first "interpretation" can be performed directly on coarse relations, and not composing disjunctions of atomic relations.
By defining the tractable fragments in such a way that their a-cuts are tractable classical subsets the tractability property is ensured [3].
5  Definition 18. nP I f uz is the subset of nQAf uz involving point-interval and interval-point relations.
Neighborhood Relations of the Fuzzy Temporal Qualitative Algebra  Definition 19. nP Af uz is the subset of nQAf uz involving point-point relations.
To develop a mode general model for representing imperfect temporal information it is now useful to add a vertical dimension taking into account other forms of imperfection different from coarseness.
To this aim it is possible to give a fuzzy extension of nQA while maintaining tractability.
This new subclass of QAf uz allows combining the "vertical" and the "horizontal" aspects of imperfect information.
The previously cited method based on a-cuts is exploited, however a particular attention has to be devoted when assigning the preference degrees to the relations: in fact, it is not sufficient to restrict all the a-cuts of a given set to belong to the classical tractable nQA, as in the case of IAf uz , where all combinations of atomic relations are possible.
In nQAf uz not all combinations are allowed, otherwise sets belonging to upper a-cuts could have relations which are not present in lower a-cuts (see Figure 3).
It is necessary to guarantee that upper a-cuts are subsets of lower a-cuts.
Proposition 20.
The algebra nQAf uz is tractable.
f uz Proof.
nQAf uz is a subset of the tractable algebra JK18 identified in [3].
A method to ensure the inclusion of upper a-cuts in lower a-cuts is to create a hierarchy of nQA relations, Schilder has proposed such a hierarchy for SAc exploiting relations between endpoints [20].
In this paper the hierarchies for nP A and nP I are proposed; they have been represented in Figures 4 and 5.
A well formed nQAf uz relation can be always be interpreted as an IAf uz relation, but the vertical bars that represent preference degrees can, in this case, also be drawn as horizontal bars that represent neighborhood relations (Figure 6).
Such a bi-dimensional representation is sufficient for visualizing nQAf uz subsets involving point-point or pointinterval relations, that is nP I f uz and nP Af uz relations, while the subset involving interval-interval relations (i.e.
nIAf uz relations) needs a 3D graph, which, for example, could be based on the neighborhood structure (Figure 7).
A nQAf uz relation can therefore be defined by means of its a-cuts, and preference degrees can refer to these, instead of being associated to each atomic relation.
This problem was not addressed in a similar work proposed by Guesgen's [11], since there preference degrees were assigned by the user.
Here, instead, an additional condition is needed, and to avoid this problem the definition for nQAf uz becomes: 6  ?
pr  sd  Figure 6. from fuzzy relations to fuzzy neighbor relations b  eq  a  {ct[1.0, ]nb [?]
na[0.8]} (for this hierarchy refer to Figure 5 of Schilder's paper [20]); in this way the problem becomes less "rigid" and additional less preferred solutions can be possibly obtained.

The P Af uz relation {< [a1 ], = [a2 ], > [a3 ]}, a1 > a2 > a3 represented on the left of Figure 6 is a well-formed nP Af uz relation and it is written as {< [a10 ], pr[a20 ], ?

These hierarchies have the additional advantage that they allow, in a sense, to identify multiple levels of coarseness (e.g.
: relation bd is coarser than relation ds, which in turn is coarser than relation s) and to reason using these different levels grouped by the preference degrees.
Therefore, the preference degrees themselves can be assigned referring to the hierarchies.
6  Conclusions  The concepts of neighborhood and fuzzy relation have been combined in this study and two new tractable subalgebras, nQA and its fuzzy extension nQAf uz , have been defined.
nQA allows reasoning with intervals and points in a coarse way, nQAf uz adds to it the possibility to perform both a "horizontal" reasoning about similar relations and a "vertical" reasoning connecting concepts with their definitions.
Now, a possible direction is to consider how such rich fuzzy relations can be expressed in a more human friendly  Example 22.
In the classical Meiri's scenario about John and Fred there are 3 types of qualitative relations involved: s, f and {s, si, d, di, f, f i, o, oi, eq}.
The last set is semantically equivalent to the coarse relation ct.
It is possible to relax these qualitative constraints in lower a-cuts by following the links in the hierarchies.
For instance, s can be relaxed in {s[1.0], bd[0.7]}, f in {f [1.0, ]db[0.7]} and ct in 7  way, in order to exploit their full potential, for example using simple sentences which could possibly be re-interpreted back in terms of nQAf uz relations.
Another direction, which is currently under consideration, is the integration of the new coarse relations into the system FTR [2] and their interactions with fuzzy metric constraints.
