2010 17th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  Axiomatizing the temporal logic defined over the class of all lexicographic products of dense linear orders without endpoints Philippe Balbiani Institut de recherche en informatique de Toulouse CNRS -- Universite de Toulouse 118 ROUTE DE NARBONNE, 31062 TOULOUSE CEDEX 9, France Philippe.Balbiani@irit.fr  Abstract--This article considers the temporal logic defined over the class of all lexicographic products of dense linear orders without endpoints and provides a complete axiomatization for it.
II.
L EXICOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS OF LINEAR ORDERS Let (S, <S ) and (T, <T ) be dense linear orders without endpoints.
Their lexicographic product is the structure F = (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) where R = S x T and [?
]1 and [?
]2 are the binary relations on R defined by (s, t) [?
]1 (s0 , t0 ) iff s <S s0 and (s, t) [?
]2 (s0 , t0 ) iff s = s0 and t <T t0 .
The effect of the operation of lexicographic product may be described informally as follows: F is the structure obtained from (S, <S ) and (T, <T ) by replacing each element of (S, <S ) by a copy of (T, <T ).
See [3] or [6] for a discussion about the global intuitions underlying such an operation.
In order to characterize its elementary properties, we introduce a firstorder language.
Let V ar denote a countable set of individual variables (with typical members denoted x, y, etc).
The set of all well-formed formulas (with typical members denoted ph, ps, etc) of the first-order language is given by the rule * ph := x <1 y | x <2 y | [?]
| !ph | (ph[?
]ps) | [?
]x ph | x = y.
The intended meanings of x <1 y and x <2 y are as follows: "x precedes but is not infinitely close to y" and "x precedes and is infinitely close to y".
We adopt the standard definitions for the remaining Boolean operations and for the existential quantifier.
Another construct can be defined in terms of the primitive ones as follows: * x < y := x <1 y [?]
x <2 y.
The intended meaning of x < y is as follows: "x precedes y".
The notion of a subformula is standard.
We adopt the standard rules for omission of the parentheses.
Formulas in which every individual variable in an atomic subformula is in the scope of a corresponding quantifier are called sentences.
Models for the first-order language are flows F = (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) where R is a nonempty set of instants and [?
]1 and [?
]2 are binary relations on R. We define the binary relation [?]
on R by t [?]
u iff either t [?
]1 u, or t [?
]2 u for each t, u [?]
R. An assignment on F is a function f : V ar 7- R. Satisfaction is a 3-place relation |= between a flow F = (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ), an assignment f on F and a formula ph.
It is inductively defined as usual.
In particular, * F |=f x <1 y iff f (x) [?
]1 f (y) and * F |=f x <2 y iff f (x) [?
]2 f (y).
As a result,  I. I NTRODUCTION Given modal logics L1 and L2 in languages respectively based on 21 and 22 , their "Cartesian" product is a multimodal logic in the language based on both 21 and 22 .
Its semantics is based on the product F1 x F2 = (W, S1 , S2 ) of structures F1 = (W1 , R1 ) and F2 = (W2 , R2 ) defined by: W = W1 x W2 , (x1 , x2 ) S1 (y1 , y2 ) iff x1 R1 y1 and x2 = y2 and (x1 , x2 ) S2 (y1 , y2 ) iff x1 = y1 and x2 R2 y2 .
The above product of structures has been considered within the context of reasoning about knowledge [7].
See [9] for a detailed study of the axiomatization of the corresponding modal logics.
Given modal logics L1 and L2 in languages respectively based on 21 and 22 , it also makes sense to consider their "lexicographic" product defined as a multimodal logic in the language based on both 21 and 22 .
Its semantics is based on the product F1  F2 = (W, S1 , S2 ) of structures F1 = (W1 , R1 ) and F2 = (W2 , R2 ) defined by: W = W1 x W2 , (x1 , x2 ) S1 (y1 , y2 ) iff x1 R1 y1 and (x1 , x2 ) S2 (y1 , y2 ) iff x1 = y1 and x2 R2 y2 .
The above product of structures has been considered within the context of reasoning about time [1].
See [2] for a first step towards the axiomatization of the corresponding modal logics.
This article considers the temporal logic defined over the class of all lexicographic products of dense linear orders without endpoints and gives its complete axiomatization.
Its section-by-section breakdown is as follows.
Section II defines the lexicographic product of dense linear orders without endpoints and studies its elementary properties.
In section III, we introduce the syntax and the semantics of the temporal logic we will be working with.
Section IV gives its axiomatization.
In section V and section VI, a method is presented for proving the completeness of this axiomatization.
Section VII pays particular attention to the pure future fragment of our temporal language.

f (y).
Obviously, every lexicographic product of dense linear orders without endpoints satisfies the following sentences: IRRE * [?
]x x 6<1 x, * [?
]x x 6<2 x, DISJ * [?
]x [?
]y (x 6<1 y [?]

]x [?
]y y <2 x and U N IV * [?
]x [?
]y (x = y [?]
x <1 y [?]
x <2 y [?]
y <1 x [?]
y <2 x).
Obviously, the sentences as above have not the finite model property.
By Lowenheim-Skolem theorem, they have models in each infinite power.
A flow F = (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) is said to be standard iff it satisfies the sentences as above.
Let F = (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) be a flow, R be a binary relation on R and L be a sublanguage of our first-order language.
We shall say that R is definable with L in F iff there exists a formula ph(x, y) in L such that for all assignments f on F , f (x) R f (y) iff F |=f ph(x, y).
Proposition 1: (1) = is not definable with <1 in any standard flow; (2) = is definable with <2 in any standard flow; (3) [?
]2 is not definable with = and <1 in any standard flow; (4) [?
]1 is not definable with = and <2 in any standard flow; (5) [?
]1 is not definable with = and < in any standard flow; (6) [?
]2 is not definable with = and < in any standard flow.
The following proposition illustrates the value of countable standard flows.
Proposition 2: Let F = (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) and F 0 = (R0 , [?
]01 , 0 [?
]2 ) be standard flows.
If F is countable then F is elementary embeddable in F 0 .
As a corollary of proposition 2 we obtain that any two standard flows are elementary equivalent.
The first-order theory HY of standard flows has the following list of proper axioms: IRRE, DISJ, T RAN , DEN S, SERI and U N IV .
There are several results about HY : Proposition 3: (1) HY is countably categorical; (2) HY is not categorical in any uncountable power; (3) HY is maximal consistent; (4) HY is complete with respect to the lexicographic product of any dense linear orders without endpoints.
The membership problem in HY is this: given a sentence ph, determine whether ph is in HY .
The results are summarized in the following proposition:  Proposition 4: (1) HY is decidable; (2) The membership problem in HY is P SP ACE-complete.
See [1] for the proofs of the above results.
*  III.
A TEMPORAL LOGIC It is now time to meet the temporal logic we will be working with.
A. Syntax Let At be a countable set of atomic formulas (with typical members denoted p, q, etc).
We define the set of formulas of the temporal language (with typical members denoted ph, ps, etc) as follows: * ph := p | [?]
| !ph | (ph [?]
ps) | G1 ph | G2 ph | H1 ph | H2 ph, the formulas G1 ph and G2 ph being read "ph will be true at each instant within the future of but not infinitely close to the present instant" and "ph will be true at each instant within the future of and infinitely close to the present instant" and the formulas H1 ph and H2 ph being read "ph has been true at each instant within the past of but not infinitely close to the present instant" and "ph has been true at each instant within the past of and infinitely close to the present instant".
We adopt the standard definitions for the remaining Boolean connectives.
As usual, we define * Fi ph := !Gi !ph and * Pi ph := !Hi !ph for each i [?]
{1, 2}.
The notion of a subformula is standard.
It is usual to omit parentheses if this does not lead to any ambiguity.
B.
Semantics A Kripke model is a structure M = (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) where (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) is a flow and V : R 7- 2At is a function.
V -1 : At 7- 2R will denote the function such that V -1 (p) = {s [?]
R: p [?]
V (s)}.
Satisfaction is a 3-place relation |= between a Kripke model M = (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ), an instant t [?]
R and a formula ph.
It is inductively defined as usual.
In particular, for all i [?]
{1, 2}, * M |=t Gi ph iff M |=u ph for each instant u [?]
R such that t [?
]i u and * M |=t Hi ph iff M |=u ph for each instant u [?]
R such that u [?
]i t. As a result, for all i [?]
{1, 2}, * M |=t Fi ph iff M |=u ph for some instant u [?]
R such that t [?
]i u and * M |=t Pi ph iff M |=u ph for some instant u [?]
R such that u [?
]i t. Let ph be a formula.
We shall say that ph is true in a Kripke model M = (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ), in symbols M |= ph, iff M |=t ph for each instant t [?]
R. ph is said to be valid in a flow (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ), in symbols (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) |= ph, iff M |= ph for each Kripke model M = (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) based on (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ).
We shall say that ph is valid in a class C of flows, in symbols  20  C |= ph, iff (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) |= ph for each flow (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) in C. The class of all standard flows will be denoted more briefly as Cs whereas the class of all countable standard flows will be denoted more briefly as Csc .
A flow (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) is said to be prestandard iff it satisfies T RAN , DEN S, SERI and the following sentences: LIN E * [?
]x [?
]y ([?
]z (z <1 x [?]
z <1 y) - x = y [?]
x <1 y [?]
x <2 y [?]
y <1 x [?]
y <2 x), * [?
]x [?
]y ([?
]z (z <1 x [?]
z <2 y) - y <1 x), * [?
]x [?
]y ([?
]z (z <2 x [?]
z <1 y) - x <1 y), * [?
]x [?
]y ([?
]z (z <2 x [?]
z <2 y) - x = y [?]
x <2 y [?]
y <2 x), * [?
]x [?
]y ([?
]z (x <1 z [?]
y <1 z) - x = y [?]
x <1 y [?]
x <2 y [?]
y <1 x [?]
y <2 x), * [?
]x [?
]y ([?
]z (x <1 z [?]
y <2 z) - x <1 y), * [?
]x [?
]y ([?
]z (x <2 z [?]
y <1 z) - y <1 x) and * [?
]x [?
]y ([?
]z (x <2 z [?]
y <2 z) - x = y [?]
x <2 y [?]
y <2 x).
The class of all prestandard flows will be denoted more briefly as Cp whereas the class of all countable prestandard flows will be denoted more briefly as Cpc .
Proposition 6: Let ph be a formula.
If Cp |= ph then ph [?]
HT L. Proof: It suffices to observe that the proper axioms 4 and d and the proper axioms D and L and their mirror images are Sahlqvist formulas and correspond to sentences in a very precise way: 4 corresponds to T RAN , d corresponds to DEN S, D and its mirror image correspond to SERI and L and its mirror image correspond to LIN E. Then use Sahlqvist completeness theorem [4].
Obviously, every standard flow is prestandard.
Conversely, the importance of prestandard flows lies in the fact that every countable prestandard flow satisfying U N IV is a bounded morphic image of every countable standard flow.
A proof of this fact will be found in section VI.
C. Bounded morphisms Let (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) and (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) be flows.
A function f : R 7- R0 is a bounded morphism from (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) to (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) iff the following conditions are satisfied for each i [?]
{1, 2}: 0 0 0 0 * for all t [?]
R and for all u [?]
R , f (t) [?
]i u iff there exists u [?]
R such that t [?
]i u and f (u) = u0 and 0 0 0 0 * for all t [?]
R and for all u [?]
R , u [?
]i f (t) iff there exists u [?]
R such that u [?
]i t and f (u) = u0 .
If there is a surjective bounded morphism from (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) to (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) then we say that (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) is a bounded morphic image of (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ).
Lemma 1: Let (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) and (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) be flows.
If (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) is a bounded morphic image of (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) then for all formulas ph, if (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) |= ph then (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) |= ph.
Proof: Use the bounded morphism lemma [4].
IV.
A XIOMATIZATION A temporal logic is defined to be any normal logic in the temporal language that contains the formulas * ph - Gi Pi ph and * ph - Hi Fi ph as proper axioms for each i [?]
{1, 2}.
Notice that these formulas come in pairs of "mirror images" obtained by interchanging future and past connectives.
Let HT L be the smallest temporal logic that contains the formulas 4 * F1 F1 ph - F1 ph, * F1 F2 ph - F1 ph, * F2 F1 ph - F1 ph, * F2 F2 ph - F2 ph, d * F1 ph - F1 F1 ph, * F1 ph - F1 F2 ph, * F1 ph - F2 F1 ph and * F2 ph - F2 F2 ph and the formulas D * F1 >, * F2 >, L * F1 ph [?]

Proposition 5: Let ph be a formula.
If ph [?]
HT L then Cs |= ph.
Proof: Left to the reader.
V. P RELIMINARY LEMMAS Let (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) be a standard flow and (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) be a prestandard flow.
Suppose R and R0 are countable.
The four following lemmas constitute the heart of our method.
Lemma 2: Let s [?]
R and s0 [?]
R0 .
The partial function f : R 7- R0 defined by dom(f ) = {s} and f (s) = s0 is a partial homomorphism with finite nonempty domain.
Proof: Obvious.
The partial function f : R 7- R0 defined by lemma 2 is called initial function with respect to s and s0 .
Lemma 3: Let s [?]
R and f : R 7- R0 be a partial homomorphism with finite nonempty domain.
There exists a partial homomorphism g: R 7- R0 with finite nonempty domain such that dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{s} and g(t) = f (t) for each t [?]
dom(f ).
Proof: Since dom(f ) is finite and nonempty, then there exists a positive integer k and there exists w1 , .
.
.
, wk [?]
R such that {w1 , .
.
.
, wk } = dom(f ).
Let us remind that (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) is standard.
Hence, without loss of generality, we may assume that w1 [?]
.
.
.
[?]
wk .
Now, consider the four following cases.
21  1) Suppose i = 1 and j1 = 1.
Hence, f (s) [?
]01 t0 and f (s) [?
]01 f (t1 ).
Since (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) satisfies LIN E, then either t0 = f (t1 ), or t0 [?
]01 f (t1 ), or t0 [?
]02 f (t1 ), or f (t1 ) [?
]01 t0 , or f (t1 ) [?
]02 t0 .
Now, consider the five following cases.
1) Suppose there exists a positive integer l such that l <= k and s = wl .
Let g: R 7- R0 be the partial function defined by dom(g) = dom(f ) and g(t) = f (t) for each t [?]
dom(f ).
2) Suppose there exists a positive integer l such that 1 <= l - 1, l <= k, wl-1 [?]
s and s [?]
wl .
Since (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) satisfies DISJ, then wl-1 [?
]i s for exactly one i [?]
{1, 2} and s [?
]j wl for exactly one j [?]
{1, 2}.
Since (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) satisfies T RAN , f : R 7- R0 is a partial homorphism and (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) satisfies DEN S, then there exists s0 [?]
R0 such that f (wl-1 ) [?
]0i s0 and s0 [?
]0j f (wl ).
Let g: R 7- R0 be the partial function defined by dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{s}, g(t) = f (t) for each t [?]
dom(f ) and g(s) = s0 .
3) Suppose s [?]
w1 .
Since (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) satisfies DISJ, then s [?
]i w1 for exactly one i [?]
{1, 2}.
Since (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) satisfies SERI, then there exists s0 [?]
R0 such that s0 [?
]0i f (w1 ).
Let g: R 7- R0 be the partial function defined by dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{s}, g(t) = f (t) for each t [?]
dom(f ) and g(s) = s0 .
4) Suppose wk [?]
s. Since (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) satisfies DISJ, then wk [?
]i s for exactly one i [?]
{1, 2}.
Since (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) satisfies SERI, then there exists s0 [?]
R0 such that f (wk ) [?
]0i s0 .
Let g: R 7- R0 be the partial function defined by dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{s}, g(t) = f (t) for each t [?]
dom(f ) and g(s) = s0 .
The reader may easily verify that g: R 7- R0 is a partial homomorphism with finite nonempty domain such that dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{s} and g(t) = f (t) for each t [?]
dom(f ).
The partial function g: R 7- R0 defined by lemma 3 is called forward completion of f with respect to s. Lemma 4: Let s [?]
R, t0 [?]
R0 , i [?]
{1, 2} and f : R 7- R0 be a partial homomorphism with finite nonempty domain such that s [?]
dom(f ) and f (s) [?
]0i t0 .
There exists t [?]
R and there exists a partial homomorphism g: R 7- R0 with finite nonempty domain such that s [?
]i t, dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{t}, g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ) and g(t) = t0 .
Proof: Since dom(f ) is finite, then dom(f ) [?]
{t [?]
R: s [?]
t} is finite.
Hence, there exists a nonnegative integer k and there exists t1 , .
.
.
, tk [?]
R such that {t1 , .
.
.
, tk } = dom(f )[?
]{t [?]
R: s [?]
t}.
Let us remind that (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) is standard.
Hence, without loss of generality, we may assume that s [?]
t1 .
.
.
[?]
tk .
Since (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) satisfies DISJ, then s [?
]j1 t1 .
.
.
[?
]jk tk for exactly one k-tuple (j1 , .
.
.
, jk ) [?]
{1, 2}k .
Since f : R 7- R0 is a partial homomorphism, s [?]
dom(f ) and {t1 , .
.
.
, tk } [?]
dom(f ), then f (s) [?
]0j1 f (t1 ) .
.
.
[?
]0jk f (tk ).
Now, we proceed by induction on k. Basis.
Suppose k = 0.
Since (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) satisfies SERI, then there exists t [?]
R such that s [?
]i t. Let g: R 7- R0 be the partial function defined by dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{t}, g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ) and g(t) = t0 .
Step.
Suppose k > 1.
Now, consider the four following cases.
a) Suppose t0 = f (t1 ).
Let g: R 7- R0 be the partial function defined by dom(g) = dom(f ) and g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ).
b) Suppose t0 [?
]01 f (t1 ).
Since (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) satisfies DEN S, then there exists t [?]
R such that s [?
]1 t and t [?
]1 t1 .
Let g: R 7- R0 be the partial function defined by dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{t}, g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ) and g(t) = t0 .
c) Suppose t0 [?
]02 f (t1 ).
Since (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) satisfies DEN S, then there exists t [?]
R such that s [?
]1 t and t [?
]2 t1 .
Let g: R 7- R0 be the partial function defined by dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{t}, g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ) and g(t) = t0 .
d) Suppose f (t1 ) [?
]01 t0 .
Since {t2 , .
.
.
, tk } = dom(f ) [?]
{t [?]
R: t1 [?]
t}, then by induction hypothesis, there exists t [?]
R and there exists a partial homomorphism g: R 7- R0 with finite nonempty domain such that t1 [?
]1 t, dom(g) = dom(f )[?
]{t}, g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ) and g(t) = t0 .
e) Suppose f (t1 ) [?
]02 t0 .
Since {t2 , .
.
.
, tk } = dom(f ) [?]
{t [?]
R: t1 [?]
t}, then by induction hypothesis, there exists t [?]
R and there exists a partial homomorphism g: R 7- R0 with finite nonempty domain such that t1 [?
]2 t, dom(g) = dom(f )[?
]{t}, g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ) and g(t) = t0 .
2) Suppose i = 1 and j1 = 2.
Hence, f (s) [?
]01 t0 and f (s) [?
]02 f (t1 ).
Since (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) satisfies LIN E, then f (t1 ) [?
]01 t0 .
Since {t2 , .
.
.
, tk } = dom(f ) [?]
{t [?]
R: t1 [?]
t}, then by induction hypothesis, there exists t [?]
R and there exists a partial homomorphism g: R 7- R0 with finite nonempty domain such that t1 [?
]1 t, dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{t}, g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ) and g(t) = t0 .
3) Suppose i = 2 and j1 = 1.
Hence, f (s) [?
]02 t0 and f (s) [?
]01 f (t1 ).
Since (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) satisfies LIN E, then t0 [?
]01 f (t1 ).
Since (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) satisfies DEN S, then there exists t [?]
R such that s [?
]2 t and t [?
]1 t1 .
Let g: R 7- R0 be the partial function defined by dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{t}, g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ) and g(t) = t0 .
4) Suppose i = 2 and j1 = 2.
Hence, f (s) [?
]02 t0 and f (s) [?
]02 f (t1 ).
Since (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) satisfies LIN E, then either t0 = f (t1 ), or t0 [?
]02 f (t1 ), or f (t1 ) [?

Now, consider the three following cases.
22  a) Suppose t0 = f (t1 ).
Let g: R 7- R0 be the partial function defined by dom(g) = dom(f ) and g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ).
b) Suppose t0 [?
]02 f (t1 ).
Since (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) satisfies DEN S, then there exists t [?]
R such that s [?
]2 t and t [?
]2 t1 .
Let g: R 7- R0 be the partial function defined by dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{t}, g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ) and g(t) = t0 .
c) Suppose f (t1 ) [?
]02 t0 .
Since {t2 , .
.
.
, tk } = dom(f ) [?]
{t [?]
R: t1 [?]
t}, then by induction hypothesis, there exists t [?]
R and there exists a partial homomorphism g: R 7- R0 with finite nonempty domain such that t1 [?
]2 t, dom(g) = dom(f )[?
]{t}, g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ) and g(t) = t0 .
The reader may easily verify that g: R 7- R0 is a partial homomorphism with finite nonempty domain such that s [?
]i t, dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{t}, g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ) and g(t) = t0 .
The partial function g: R 7- R0 defined by lemma 4 is called left-backward completion of f with respect to s, t0 and i. Lemma 5: Let s [?]
R, t0 [?]
R0 , i [?]
{1, 2} and f : R 7- R0 be a partial homomorphism with finite nonempty domain such that s [?]
dom(f ) and t0 [?
]0i f (s).
There exists t [?]
R and there exists a partial homomorphism g: R 7- R0 with finite nonempty domain such that t [?
]i s, dom(g) = dom(f ) [?]
{t}, g(u) = f (u) for each u [?]
dom(f ) and g(t) = t0 .
Proof: Similar to the proof of lemma 4 The partial function g: R 7- R0 defined by lemma 5 is called right-backward completion of f with respect to s, t0 and i.
Basis.
Let f0 : R 7- R0 be the initial function with respect to s0 and s00 .
Step.
Let gn : R 7- R0 be the forward completion of fn with respect to tn , hn : R 7- R0 be the left-backward completion of gn with respect to tn , u0n and in and fn+1 : R 7- R0 be the right-backward completion of hn with respect to tn , u0n and in .
The reader may easily verify that the sequence f0 : R 7- R0 , f1 : R 7- R0 , .

of partial homomorphisms with finite nonempty domains is such that dom(f0 ) [?]

., {dom(fn ): n is a nonnegative integer} = R and for all nonnegative integers n, fn+1 (s) = fn (s) for each s [?]
dom(fn ).
Let f : R 7- R0 be the function defined by dom(f ) = R and f (s) = fn (s) for each s [?]
R, n being a nonnegative integer such that s [?]
dom(fn ).
The reader may easily verify that f : R 7- R0 is a surjective bounded morphism from (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) to (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ).
The result that emerges from the discussion above is the following theorem.
Theorem 1: Let ph be a formula.
The following conditions are equivalent: 1) ph [?]
HT L; 2) Cs |= ph; 3) Csc |= ph; 4) Cp |= ph; 5) Cpc |= ph.
Proof: (1) - (2).
Use proposition 5.

P URE FUTURE FORMULAS  We can now prove the following proposition.
Proposition 7: Let (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) be a standard flow and (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) be a prestandard flow.
If R and R0 are countable and R0 satisfies U N IV then (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) is a bounded morphic image of (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ).
Proof: One main idea underlies our step-by-step method: we think of the construction of the surjective bounded morphism from (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) to (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) as a process approaching a limit via a sequence f0 : R 7- R0 , f1 : R 7- R0 , .
.
.
of partial homomorphisms with finite nonempty domains.
Lemma 2 is used to initiate the construction whereas lemmas 3, 4 and 5 are used to make improvements at each step of the construction.
Let s0 [?]
R and s00 [?]
R0 .
Consider an enumeration (t0 , u00 , i0 ), (t1 , u01 , i1 ), .
.
.
of RxR0 x{1, 2} where each item appears infinitely often.
We inductively define a sequence f0 : R 7- R0 , f1 : R 7- R0 , .
.
.
of partial homomorphisms with finite nonempty domains as follows:  ph is said to be a pure future formula iff it contains no occurrence of the temporal connectives H1 and H2 .
We do not know whether all standard flows validate the same pure future formulas.
Nevertheless, Proposition 8: For all pure future formulas ph, ph is valid in the lexicographic flow defined over (Q, <) and (R, <) iff ph is valid in the lexicographic flow defined over (Q, <) and (Q, <).
Proof: Let (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) be the lexicographic flow defined over (Q, <) and (R, <) and (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) be the lexicographic flow defined over (Q, <) and (Q, <).
Suppose (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) 6|= ph.
Hence, there exists a function V 0 : R0 7- 2At , there exists t0 [?]
Q and there exists u0 [?]
Q such that (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 , V 0 ) 6|=(t0 ,u0 ) ph.
Let m be the function from QxR to the set of all maximal propositionally consistent sets of formulas such that for all t [?]
Q and for all u [?]
R, either u [?]
Q and m(t, u) [?]
{ps: (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 , V 0 ) |=(t,u) ps}, or u 6[?]
Q and m(t, u) [?]
{ps: there exists u0 [?]
Q  23  axioms then the corresponding formula ph2 based on G2 is valid in Cs .
Reciprocally, suppose ph is not derivable from the above axioms.
Therefore, by Sahlqvist completeness theorem, there exists a generated structure (W, R) where W is a nonempty set of instants and R is a binary relation on W such that * for all t, u [?]
W , if there exists v [?]
W such that t R v and v R u then t R u, * for all t, u [?]
W , if t R u then there exists v [?]
W such that t R v and v R u, * for all t [?]
W , there exists u [?]
W such that t R u and * for all t, u, v [?]
W , if t R u and t R v then u = v or u R v or v R u, there exists a function V : W 7- 2At and there exists t0 [?]
W such that (W, R, V ) 6|=t0 ph.
Let (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) be the flow defined by R0 = W [?]{[?]}
where [?]
is a new instant and [?
]01 and [?
]02 are the binary relations on R0 defined by t0 [?
]01 u0 iff u0 = [?]
and t0 [?
]02 u0 iff either t0 , u0 [?]
W and t0 R u0 , or t0 = [?]
and u0 = [?]
and V 0 : R0 7- 2At be a function such -1 that V 0 (p) = V -1 (p).
The reader may easily verify that 0 0 (R , [?
]1 , [?
]02 ) is prestandard and such that (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 , V 0 ) 6|=t0 ph2 .
By theorem 1, ph2 is not valid in Cs .
Consider a flow (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) and i, j [?]
{1, 2} be such that i 6= j.
We shall say that Gi is definable with Gj in (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) iff there exists a formula ph(p) with Gj such that (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) |= Gi p - ph(p).
Proposition 11: (1) G1 is not definable with G2 in any standard flow; (2) G2 is not definable with G1 in any standard flow.
Proof: Let (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) be a standard flow (1) Suppose there exists a formula ph(p) in G2 such that R |= G1 p - ph(p).
Let t, u [?]
R be such that t [?
]1 u.
We need to consider a function V : R 7- 2At such that V -1 (p) = {s [?]
R: t [?
]1 s} and a function V 0 : R 7- 2At -1 such that V 0 (p) = {s [?]
R: t [?
]1 s} \ {s [?]
R: not s [?
]1 u}.
Notice that (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t G1 p and (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) 6|=t G1 p. As a simple exercise, we invite the reader to show by induction on the complexity of formulas ps(p) in G2 that (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t ps(p) iff (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) |=t ps(p).
Hence, (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t ph(p) iff (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) |=t ph(p).
Thus, (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t G1 p iff (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) |=t G1 p. These facts together constitute a contradiction.
(2) Suppose there exists a formula ph(p) in G1 such that R |= G2 p - ph(p).
Let t, u [?]
R be such that t [?
]2 u.
We need to consider a function V : R 7- 2At such that V -1 (p) = {s [?]
R: t [?
]2 s} and a function V 0 : R 7- 2At -1 such that V 0 (p) = {s [?]
R: t [?
]2 s} \ {s [?]
R: not s [?
]2 u}.
Notice that (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t G2 p and (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) 6|=t G2 p. As a simple exercise, we invite the reader to show by induction on the complexity of formulas ps(p) in G1 that (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t ps(p) iff (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) |=t ps(p).
Hence, (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t ph(p) iff (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) |=t ph(p).
Thus, (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t G2 p iff (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) |=t G2 p. These facts together constitute a contradiction.
such that u < u0 and for all u00 [?]
Q, if u < u00 and u00 < u0 then (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 , V 0 ) |=(t,u00 ) ps}.
Since (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 , V 0 ) 6|=(t0 ,u0 ) ph, hence, ph 6[?]
m(t0 , u0 ).
We define a function V : R 7- 2At by V (t, u) = m(t, u) [?]
At for each t [?]
Q and for each u [?]
R. As a simple exercise, we invite the reader to show by induction on the complexity of pure future formulas ps that for all t [?]
Q and for all u [?]
R, (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=(t,u) ps iff ps [?]
m(t, u).
Since ph 6[?]
m(t0 , u0 ), then (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) 6|=(t0 ,u0 ) ph.
Therefore, (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) 6|= ph.
Suppose (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) |= ph.
Since HY is countably categorical, then Csc |= ph.
By theorem 1, Cs |= ph.
Hence, (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) |= ph.
There is no known complete axiomatization of the set of all Cs -valid pure future formulas.
Let HT Li denotes the restriction of HT L to the set of formulas based on the temporal connective Gi for each i [?]
{1, 2}.
Proposition 9: HT L1 is equivalent to the smallest normal logic that contains, in the language based on 2, the following formulas as proper axioms: 33ph - 3ph, 3ph - 33ph, 3> and 3(2ph [?]
3ps) - 2(ph [?]
3ps).
Proof: Let ph be a formula based on 2.
Obviously, as the reader is asked to show, if ph is derivable from the above axioms then the corresponding formula ph1 based on G1 is valid in Cs .
Reciprocally, suppose ph is not derivable from the above axioms.
Therefore, by Sahlqvist completeness theorem, there exists a generated structure (W, R) where W is a nonempty set of instants and R is a binary relation on W such that * for all t, u [?]
W , if there exists v [?]
W such that t R v and v R u then t R u, * for all t, u [?]
W , if t R u then there exists v [?]
W such that t R v and v R u, * for all t [?]
W , there exists u [?]
W such that t R u and * for all t, u, v [?]
W , if t R u and t R v then either {w [?]
W : u R w} = {w [?]
W : v R w}, or u R v, or v R u, there exists a function V : W 7- 2At and there exists t0 [?]
W such that (W, R, V ) 6|=t0 ph.
Let ~ be the binary relation on W defined by t ~ u iff either t = u, or not t R u and not u R t for each t, u [?]
W .
The reader may easily verify that ~ is an equivalence relation on W .
Let (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 ) be the flow defined by R0 = W and [?
]01 and [?
]02 are the binary relations on R0 defined by t0 [?
]01 u0 iff t0 R u0 and t0 [?
]02 u0 iff t0 ~ u0 and V 0 : R0 7- 2At be a function such -1 that V 0 (p) = V -1 (p).
The reader may easily verify that 0 0 (R , [?
]1 , [?
]02 ) is prestandard and such that (R0 , [?
]01 , [?
]02 , V 0 ) 6|=t0 ph1 .
By theorem 1, ph1 is not valid in Cs .
Proposition 10: HT L2 is equivalent to the smallest normal logic that contains, in the language based on 2, the following formulas as proper axioms: 33ph - 3ph, 3ph - 33ph, 3> and 3ph [?]
3ps - 3(ph [?]
ps) [?]
3(ph [?]
3ps) [?]
3(ps [?]
3ph).
Proof: Let ph be a formula based on 2.
Obviously, as the reader is asked to show, if ph is derivable from the above  24  of two linear orderings.
All extensions of S4.3, as proved in [5], [8], possess the finite model property and all finitely axiomatizable normal extensions of K4.3, as proved in [13], are decidable.
Is it possible to obtain similar results in our lexicographic setting?
Or could undecidability results similar to the ones obtained in [12] within the context of the products of the modal logics determined by arbitrarily long linear orders be obtained in our lexicographic setting?
Thirdly, there is the question of the complexity of the temporal logic characterized by the lexicographic product of two linear orderings.
Is it possible to obtain in our lexicographic setting complexity results by following the line of reasoning suggested by [11] within the context of temporal logics?
Let Gph := (G1 ph [?]
G2 ph), the formula Gph being read "ph will be true at each instant within the future of the present instant".
As a result, for all Kripke models M = (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ), for all instants t [?]
R and for all formula ph, * M |=t Gph iff M |=u ph for each instant u [?]
R such that t [?]
u.
Consider a flow (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) and i [?]
{1, 2}.
We shall say that Gi is definable with G in (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) iff there exists a formula ph(p) with G such that (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) |= Gi p - ph(p).
Proposition 12: (1) G1 is not definable with G in any standard flow.
(2) G2 is not definable with G in any standard flow.
Proof: Let (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 ) be a standard flow (1) Suppose there exists a formula ph(p) in G such that R |= G1 p - ph(p).
Let t, u [?]
R be such that t [?
]1 u.
We need to consider a function V : R 7- 2At such that V -1 (p) = {s [?]
-1 R: t [?
]1 s} and a function V 0 : R 7- 2At such that V 0 (p) = {s [?]
R: t [?
]1 s} \ {s [?]
R: not u [?
]1 s}.
Notice that (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t G1 p and (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) 6|=t G1 p. As a simple exercise, we invite the reader to show by induction on the complexity of formulas ps(p) in G that (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t ps(p) iff (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) |=t ps(p).
Hence, (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t ph(p) iff (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) |=t ph(p).
Thus, (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t G1 p iff (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) |=t G1 p. These facts together constitute a contradiction.
(2) Suppose there exists a formula ph(p) in G such that R |= G2 p - ph(p).
Let t, u [?]
R be such that t [?
]2 u.
We need to consider a function V : R 7- 2At such that V -1 (p) = {s [?]
-1 R: t [?

R: t [?

R: not s [?
]2 u}.
Notice that (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t G2 p and (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) 6|=t G2 p. As a simple exercise, we invite the reader to show by induction on the complexity of formulas ps(p) in G that (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t ps(p) iff (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) |=t ps(p).
Hence, (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t ph(p) iff (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V 0 ) |=t ph(p).
Thus, (R, [?
]1 , [?
]2 , V ) |=t G2 p iff (R, [?
]1 , [?

C ONCLUSION This article considered the temporal logic defined over the class of all lexicographic products of dense linear orders without endpoints and gives its complete axiomatization.
Much remains to be done.
Firstly, there is the issue of the completeness of the temporal logic characterized by the lexicographic product of two linear orderings.
Could transfer results for completeness similar to the ones obtained in [10] within the context of independently axiomatizable bimodal logics be obtained in our lexicographic setting?
Secondly, there is the question of the decidability of the temporal logic characterized by the lexicographic product  [7] Fagin, R., Halpern, J., Moses, Y., Vardi, M. Reasoning About Knowledge.
