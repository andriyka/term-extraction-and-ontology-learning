Allenas hourglass: probabilistic treatment of interval relations Sergios Petridis, Georgios Paliouras and Stavros J. Perantonis NCSR aDemokritosa, IIT 15310 Aghia Paraskevi, Greece {petridis, paliourg, sper}@iit.demokritos.gr Abstract The paper is motivated by the need to handle robustly the uncertainty of temporal intervals, e.g.
as it occurs in automated event detection in video streams.
The paper introduces a two-dimensional mapping of Allenas relations, based on orthogonal characteristics of interval relations, namely relative position and relative size.
The hourglass-shaped mapping also represents limit cases that correspond to durationless intervals.
Based on this mapping, we define two sets of primitive interval relations in terms of the relative positioning and relative size of intervals.
These primitives are then used to derive a probabilistic set of Allenas relations.
A number of example cases are presented to illustrate how the proposed approach can improve the robustness of interval relations.
1.
Introduction Allenas interval calculus [1] has been used extensively for temporal reasoning [2], human mental modeling [6] and temporal databases [4].
In the context of automated information extraction from multimedia content [10], Allenas relations provide a mechanism for inferring higher level knowledge and/or querying over detected events.
However, the rigid nature of qualitative relations does not encourage their direct use, since they do not suit the inexact nature of the information extraction algorithms [5].
In particular, as pointed out in [7], qualitative interval relations may not be robust enough to small temporal perturbations.
Addressing this issue, one may consider extending Allenas relations with uncertainty values.
In [8], probability temporal interval networks are introduced, where nodes are intervals and edges are probabilistic relations.
In [9] probabilities are attached to intervals, while in [3] a fuzzy extension of Allenas algebra has been proposed.
In all of these approaches, the use of uncertainty is mostly motivated by the need to impose soft constraints on temporal relations, while the focus is on providing the algebra and algorithms  to deal with uncertainty values, once these are available.
A somehow different issue, which is the focus of this article, is how to assign uncertainty values to Allenas relations, so as to compensate for the inherent uncertainty of the automated event detection process.
Once uncertainty values are assigned to interval relations, they can be used, for example, as input to probability temporal interval networks to be checked for consistency [8] and to provide a reliable confidence index with respect to a database query [4].
We believe that this extension can improve significantly the robustness and the applicability of Allenas relations.
Assigning probabilities to interval relations, one has to account for symmetries between relations.
Such symmetries have been studied in terms of reorientation and transposition transforms (see [6] and references therein).
Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the relative size of intervals has not been used as a primary axis of symmetry.
As we show here, it turns out the relative size, together with relative duration, create a two-dimensional space, which greatly facilitates the understanding of the relations and the assignment of probabilities.
Overall, this article has three main contributions.
First, it sheds light to the geometry of Allenas relations by mapping them onto a two-dimensional hourglass configuration, where the horizontal axis corresponds to relative time and the vertical one to relative size of intervals.
Along its vertical limits, the mapping also allows to visualize cases where either the target or the reference interval is durationless.
Second, for each dimension, a probability set of ordered primitive relations is defined, namely (beforeaconcurrent withaafter) and (smalleraequisizedalarger).
A sound way to determine the probabilities of these relations, as functions of the relative size and relative position of the intervals, is detailed.
Last, a probabilistic set of Allenas relations is presented and a way to evaluate the probabilities using the primitive relations, is defined.
The rest of the article is structured as follows.
Section 2 explains the shortcomings of Allenas relations that have motivated our work.
Section 3 introduces the two-dimensional  hourglass configuration of Allenas relations.
Section 4 describes the primitive relation sets and their association to the relative size and duration of the intervals, whereas Section 5 presents the probabilistic extension of Allenas relations.
Finally, Section 6 shows the utility of the defined extension for a number of cases and Section 7 summarizes the results and highlights open issues.

Motivation Allenas relations An interval is defined as a set of real numbers with the property that any number that lies between any two numbers in the set is also included in the set.
Allen (1983) introduced a calculus for representing the temporal relation of events delimited by time intervals.
In particular, he defined 13 jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint (JEPD) qualitative relations between intervals.
These are summarized in Table 1.  .

Lack of Robustness Automated analysis results are inherently uncertain, due to the limited accuracy of the recognition algorithms.
One source of uncertainty is the inaccuracy of segment boundaries.
It is important that small differences of segmentation results should not result in significant differences in their inferred relations.
This can happen with Allenas qualitative relations, for two reasons.
First, several relations (such as Meets) require equality of time points, something which can only hold approximately in real-word extracted time intervals.
Second, negligible changes to one of the end-points, with respect to the size of the time interval may result in a different qualitative relation.
To see that, let us examine the case of two intervals of approximately the same size.
More formally, let a time duration , such that  < Ia|Xi |, axi and Ia a (0, 1) is a real number that can be chosen to be arbitrary small.
Using , we define a uniform random variable U az U (a, ).
Now let a referred time interval X = [Xb , Xe ] and let Y = [Xb + u1 , Xe + u2 ] where u1 and u2 are generated by U .
By definition, interval Y is almost equal to X but not necessarily exactly equal.
In fact, as depicted in Figure 1, several of Allenas relations may hold between X and Y, depending on u1 and u2 .
Consequently, the information that a particular relation holds between two intervals looses its significance, since most other could characterize approximately the same situation equally well.
To give an example, if X is a time interval with boundaries X = [10sec, 12sec] and Y is a time interval with boundaries Y = [2sec, 40sec], then the (only) relation holding is: (X During Y).
Although Allenas relations are complete, they may not fit very well to temporal segments that result from automated analysis, which are inherently uncertain.
In what follows, we discuss two particular such shortcomings: lack of robustness and inadequacy.
Inadequacy Another issue with Allenas relations is their inadequacy in discriminating between very different situations occurring between intervals.
This failure is a consequence of the fact that no quantitative information is taken into account.
In particular, there are cases where a a different relation would result if the end points were slightly perturbed.
Figure 2 depicts this failure in the case of three quite different situations, all being qualified as Overlaps.

Two-dimensional hourglass configuration of Allenas relations  3.
A two-dimensional interval relation space The idea that the 13 relations of Allen have some geometry is implicitly conveyed by the names of the relations: most of them come in pairs, where one is considered the inverse of the other (e.g.
Starts vs Starts-i).
It is instructive to examine how the ainversea attribute modifies each relation.
In most cases, it implies reverting the direction of time.
This is the case for the BeforeaAfter, MeetsaMeets-i and OverlapsaOverlaps-i pairs.
Interestingly, the pair DuringaDuring-i cannot be obtained by the same principle: if X happens During Y then it would still happen During Y if the time axis was reversed.
To obtain During-i we have to actually change the relative size of the intervals, i.e.
letting X being larger than Y, instead of being smaller.
Furthermore, a careful examination of the StartsaStarts-i and FinishesaFinishes-i pairs reveals that the inverse characteristic refers to both relative time position and relative size.
The Hourglass Configuration This observation led us to explore a two-dimensional configuration of Allenas relations, where one dimension corresponds to the relative position of the intervals and the other to their relative size.
Figure 3 shows how these relations may be depicted in a two-dimensional configuration that resembles an hourglass.
The horizontal axis corresponds here to the relative posi-  tion of the intervals, while the vertical one to their relative size.
The coordinate axes also introduce some symbols that correspond roughly to the probabilistic primitive relations that will be defined in Section 4 (as: before, : concurrent with, : after, >: larger, az: equisized and <: smaller).
The hourglass configuration has some nice properties.
First, by letting Y be a fixed interval and X an interval that progressively moves forward in time, the hourglass enables us to quickly visualize the relations it will go through, provided that we chose a particular relative size of intervals.
For example, when X has the same size as Y, these are: Before, Meets, Overlaps, Equals, Overlaps-i, Meets-i and After.
Moreover, the hourglass allows to distinguish between relations that are defined solely by inequalities from those that are defined also by equalities.
The regions inside and outside the hourglass correspond to the six relations defined by inequalities: Before, Overlaps, During, During-i, Overlaps-i and After.
The lines defining these regions correspond to the six relations that include an equality in their definition: Meets, Starts, Finishes, Finishes-i, Starts-i and Meets-i.
Last, the central point of the hourglass corresponds to the only relation defined by two equalities, namely the Equals relation.
Another useful property of the hourglass configuration is that it reveals the two distinct axes of symmetry of the relations: afoldinga the hourglass along the horizontal axis and around the center (relative position symmetry) makes, for example, the Before and After regions coincide, whereas afoldinga it along the vertical axis (relative size symmetry) makes the During and During-i regions coincide.
The hourglass also distinguishes between relations with respect to of the relative size of the intervals: the relations appearing at its lower part (Starts, During and Finishes) are applicable only if the first interval is smaller than the second.
whereas the relations appearing only at its upper part (Finishes-i, During-i and Starts-i) are applicable only if the first interval is larger than the second, All other relations are applicable regardless of the relative size of the intervals.
The Limits of the Hourglass The hourglass configuration allows us also to visualize the relations applicable in three limit cases, with respect to the relative size of the intervals.
Namely, the lower line (bottom) of the hourglass corresponds to the case where the first interval is infinitely smaller than the second, i.e.
it reduces to a durationless interval.
Notice that, as one should expect, the Overlaps and Overlaps-i relations do not apply here: at the limit, a time point cannot overlap with an interval.
Still on the lower line, the MeetsaStarts and FinishesaMeets-i pairs become indistinguishable when the first interval is infinitely smaller than the second.
As a result, they are displayed as single points at the lower left and right corner of the hourglass.
Similar conclusions can be drawn by looking at the up-  per line (top) of the hourglass, where the first interval is infinitely larger than the second, i.e.
the second interval becomes durationless.
Here, the Overlaps and Overlaps-i relations also do not apply, while the MeetsaFinishes-i and the Starts-iaMeets-i relations converge to the upper left and right corners of the hourglass.
A third limit case worth mentioning is when the intervals have the same size.
In this case, one can easily verify that the Starts, Starts-i, Finishes and Finishes-i relations coincide with the Equals relation.
4.
Primitive probabilistic relations Motivated by the two-dimensional configuration of Allenas relations, and in order to extend the relations with probabilities, we follow a two-step approach.
At the first step, discussed in this section, we define a number of primitive interval relations for each of the two dimensions.
In order to distinguish them from Allenas original relations, we will denote the new ones with bold letters.
These relations are not binary (hold/do not hold) but quantitative, i.e.
they hold up to a certain degree, between zero and one.
We shall discuss how this degree may be given a probabilistic interpretation.
At a second step, deferred to Section 5, we use these primitives as a basis for a probabilistic extension of Allenas relations defined by inequalities.
Note that, in all definitions, we assume intervals to have strictly positive size.
4.1.
Primitives for relative position  from the smallest interval, and thus define P (X  Y) as { P (t a Y|t a X) |X| a$?
|Y|, def P (X  Y) = (1) P (t a X|t a Y) |X| > |Y| where | AV | denotes the size of the interval: |X| = Xe a Xb Note that P (X  Y) = P (Y  X).
Moreover, we will make the assumption that there is no reason to choose one time point over another.
In this case, Eq.
(1) simplifies to { |XaSY| |X| a$?
|Y|, |X| P (X  Y) = |XaSY| |X| > |Y| |Y| When this ratio equals 1, then the smallest interval is entirely into the larger one.
Smaller probability values indicate that some part of the smaller interval is not into the larger one.
Last, zero probability will indicate that no part of one interval is within the other.
The Before and After relations The before and after relations will be denoted as as and  respectively.
When some part of X is not in Y then X is either before or after Y.
We will first deal with the case where X is not larger than Y, to ensure that all parts of X not in Y will be either only before Y or only after Y but not both.
For this definition, we need to introduce some notation.
Namely, the left complement of the interval Y = [Yb , Ye ], i.e.
the interval that covers the entire time axis until Yb , is ( denoted as Y: ( Y = (aa, Yb ) Similarly, the right complement of Y, i.e.
the interval that  The Concurrent relation Let us first define the concurrent with primitive, which we will mathematically denote as .
To do this, let us see how Allenas During is defined and see how we may extend it and attach a probability measure.
Allenas During holds iff X is entirely into Y.
As shown in Figure 1, even if a small part of X is not into Y then this relation will not hold.
In case the relation holds, we may say that athe probability of X being concurrent with Ya equals 1.
However, we may also relax the definition so that when the part of X not in Y is very small, then the concurrent with relation almost holds.
To that end, we adopt the following view: Let a point t chosen randomly in X.
What is the probability that t is also in Y?
In other words, we measure the probability P (X  Y) by considering P (t a Y|t a X).
In order to define a symmetric relation, instead of choosing t from X in all cases, we will be choosing t randomly  *  covers the entire time starting from Ye , is denoted as Y: *  Y = (Ye , +a) Now, following the same arguments as with the concurrent with relation, the probability of X being before Y is defined as the probability of choosing a random point in X that lies (  before Y, i.e.
in Y.
Formally, a|X| a$?
|Y| :  (  def  Pr(X as Y) = P (t a Y|t a X) (  |X aS Y| = |X|  (2)  Along the same line of argument, the probability of X being after Y is defined as: a|X| a$?
|Y| :  *  def  Pr(X  Y) = P (t a Y|t a X) *  |X aS Y| = |X|  (3)  Now, when |X| > |Y|, the same definitions hold but with the X and Y arguments inverted.
Namely: a|X| > |Y| :  =  .Pr(X > Y)  *  def  Pr(X as Y) = P (t a X|t a Y) *  a|X| > |Y| :  .Pr(X az Y)  |Y aS X| |Y|  (4)  .a1  .anD  .

The equisized and larger probabilities as areas of N (s, D), delimited by anAVD and nAVD .
Here, smaller is negligible and not explicitly depicted.
One may easily verify that the before and after relations are inversely related, i.e aX, Y :  Pr(X as Y) = Pr(Y  X)  Probability base with respect to relative position Altogether, the three relative position primitives introduced above (before, concurrent with and after) are complementary: the more one holds, the less the others do.
In particular, the primitives form a complete base, in the sense that, for any two intervals X and Y: Pr(X as Y) + Pr(X  Y) + Pr(X  Y) = 1 One may easily verify this, when |X| a$?
|Y|: Pr(X as Y) + Pr(X  Y) + Pr(X  Y) (  *  |X aS Y| + |X aS Y| + |X aS Y| = |X| (  *  |X aS (Y aS Y aS Y)| |X| = = =1 |X| |X| and similarly for the |X| > |Y| case.
4.2.
Primitives for relative size We now discuss the second dimension of interval relations, namely the relation between interval sizes.
In what follows we define three relative duration primitives that correspond roughly to the following cases: aV both intervals have the same size aV the first interval is smaller than the second aV the first interval is larger than the second Consider the measured ratio |X| a |Y| sE = |X| + |Y|  that takes values from (a1, +1) where the upper, respectively the lower, limit correspond to the case X has ainfinitelya greater, respectively smaller, size than Y .
Assuming that the boundaries of intervals are uncertain, we may consider that sE is the mean value of a random variable S, following the normal distribution S az N (sE, D).
We may then define the probability of X being larger (in short >), equisized (in short az) and smaller (in short <) than Y, as the cumulative probability of S taking negative values, close to zero or positive values respectively.
Figure 4 illustrates these definitions.
Formally, by letting n be a parameter n a <+ , this is expressed as: Pr(X < Y) = IS(an AV D|sE, D) Pr(X az Y) = IS(n AV D|sE, D) a IS(an AV D|sE, D)  (6) (7)  Pr(X > Y) = 1 a IS(n AV D|sE, D)  (8)  Furthermore, by making use of the complementary error function: aT a 2 2 erfc(x) = a eat dt D x the above definitions reduce to ( ) sE 1 Pr(X < Y) = erfc n + 2 D ( ( ) ( )) 1 sE sE Pr(X az Y) = 1 a erfc n a + erfc n + 2 D D ( ) 1 sE Pr(X > Y) = erfc n a 2 D Probability base for relative duration Altogether, the smaller, equisized and larger primitives are complementary.
One may easily verify that: Pr(X < Y) + Pr(X az Y) + Pr(X > Y) = 1 i.e.
they form a complete probability base.

Relative size primitives as a function of the D and n parameters.
Dependence on the D and n parameters Figure 5 illustrates how relative size probability primitives are affected when varying D and n. These parameters allow us to model our uncertainty towards the measurement and our tolerance in considering two intervals to be equisized.
Namely, D quantifies our uncertainty regarding the relative size measurement: small values of D, e.g.
D  0.1 should be used when there is a significant confidence regarding the measurement, whereas large values when measurement confidence is low.
On the other hand, n regulates our tolerance in favor of the equisized relation.
To see the consequences of choosing a particular n, let us examine the case when the measured relative size ratio is zero (s = 0).
This is the case where Pr(X az Y) is maximized.
The maximum value obtained is not 1, but equals the area of the normal distribution N (0, D) within the confidence interval (anD, +nD): n Pr(X az Y)sE=0 = erf( a ) 2 For example, when n = 1, respectively n = 2 the maximum value of equisized obtainable is 0.68, respectively 0.95.
In the previous section, we defined six primitive relations: before, concurrent with, after and smaller, equisized, larger.
One may use them directly to describe the relation between intervals.
However, our main motivation has been to use them as a basis upon which to build a probabilistic extension of Allenas relations.
Extending Allenas relations with probabilities means that two intervals may be related by more than one relations (e.g.
During and Overlaps) with specific probability degrees and that these degrees should add to 1.
We now describe this extension.
To keep notation simple, we will use the same names and symbols as Allenas.
The difference will be evident by the probability symbol.
To give an example, the fact that athe probability that X and Y are related by Allenas During-i relation (di) is 0.7a will be denoted as Pr(X di Y) = 0.7.
The reader can easily verify that the proposed extension will form a probability set, in the sense that: aX, Y : Pr(X b Y) + Pr(X o Y) + Pr(X d Y) + Pr(X di Y) + Pr(X oi Y) + Pr(X a Y) = 1  5.1.
The before and after relations From Figure 3 one may observe that Allenas Before and After relations are independent of the relative size dimension.
Therefore, their probabilistic extension should also be independent of the relative size of the intervals.
Namely, we may use directly the relative position primitives, as defined in Eq.
(2)-(5), and define Before and After simply as def  Pr(X b Y) = Pr(X as Y) def  Pr(X a Y) = Pr(X  Y) Note that we have used the symbols b and a for Allenas relations instead of the commonly used < and > which are used here for the relative size primitives.
5.2.
The during and during-i relations The definition of these relations is facilitated by three limits along the relative duration axis of the hourglass, i.e.
when the first interval is (a) infinitely smaller, (b) equisized and (c) infinitely larger than the second.
At the infinitely smaller limit, the probability of Duringi will always be zero, whereas the probability of During is complementary to the probability of being before or after, since no other relation is possible.
Therefore the probability  of During is measured here directly by the concurrent with primitive as defined in Eq.
(1): lim  Pr(X d Y) = Pr(X  Y)  lim  Pr(X di Y) = 0  Pr(X < Y)a1 Pr(X < Y)a1  Following similar arguments, for the infinitely larger limit, the following constraints should be respected: lim  Pr(X di Y) = Pr(X  Y)  lim  Pr(X d Y) = 0  Pr(X > Y)a1  Pr(X > Y)a1  Finally, at the equisized limit, both probabilities should go to zero: lim  Pr(X di Y) = 0  lim  Pr(X d Y) = 0  Pr(X az Y)a1  Pr(X az Y)a1  Taking into account that both Pr(X < Y) and Pr(X > Y) go to zero when Pr(X az Y) goes to one (see Eq.
(6)-(8)), all the above constraints are satisfied by the following definitions: def  Pr(X d Y) = Pr(X < Y) Pr(X  Y) and def  Pr(X di Y) = Pr(X > Y) Pr(X  Y)  .
.
(1) X = [1, 12], Y = [10, 20] b o d 0.82 0.14 0.00 di oi a 0.04 0.00 0.00  .

Therefore, one may add the following constraints: Pr(X  Y) = 0 : lim  Pr(X o Y) = Pr(X  Y)  lim  Pr(X oi Y) = 0  Pr(X az Y)a1  and Pr(X  Y) > 0 : lim Pr(X o Y) = 0 Pr(X az Y)a1  (Pr(X o Y) + Pr(X oi Y)) = Pr(X  Y)  lim  Pr(X az Y)a1  Pr(X az Y)a1  lim  Pr(X o Y) = 0  lim  Pr(X oi Y) = 0  Pr(X > Y)a1 Pr(X > Y)a1  These can be verified easily by looking at the hourglass configuration in Figure 3.
In particular, the second constraint here implies that when two intervals are equisized and they overlap, whether left or right, the overall extent of the overlap is given by the ratio of their intersection to their total size.
Moreover, one may notice that the probability of Overlaps (respectively  (6) X = [22, 26], Y = [10, 20] b o d 0.00 0.00 0.00 di oi a 0.00 0.00 1.00  Figure 6.

5.3.
The overlaps and overlaps-i relations Similarly to the During and During-i cases, a number of constraints may be derived for the three limit cases.
Namely:  (2) X = [8, 19], Y = [10, 20] b o d 0.18 0.62 0.02 di oi a 0.19 0.00 0.00  Pr(X oi Y) = Pr(X  Y)  Following similar arguments to Section 5.2, these relations are defined as: { Pr(X az Y) Pr(X  Y) Pr(X  Y) = 0 def Pr(X o Y) = 0 Pr(X  Y) = 0 and { Pr(X az Y) Pr(X  Y) Pr(X oi Y) = 0 def  Pr(X  Y) > 0 .
Pr(X  Y) = 0  6.
Examples To illustrate how the proposed approach improves the robustness and expressiveness of interval relations, we present here its application to examples similar to those described in Section 2.
In particular, Figure 6 illustrates cases with different (qualitative) interval relations, namely Overlaps, During, Overlaps-i and During-i and After.
Using the probabilistic extension proposed here, probabilities are obtained for several relations in each case.
The most probable relation is highlighted with bold letters.
In almost all cases, the most probable relation coincides with the qualitative one, i.e.
the one that would have been obtained by directly applying Allenas definitions.
However, probabilities provide additional expressiveness, since their values depend on the extent to which each relation holds.
For instance, the Overlaps relation in case (2) has greater probability than the Overlaps-i relation in case (5).
This is because in case (5), the intervals overlap more than in case (5).
Furthermore, by applying the probabilistic extension proposed here, relations become more robust with respect to boundary uncertainties.
In particular, as one may notice by looking in case (1), a direct application of Allenas definitions would qualify the relation between X and Y as Overlaps.
However, this hides the fact that X is almost before Y and the fact that they overlap may be due to uncertain measurements.
Using the probabilistic extension, the information regarding the intervals relation is richer: both Before and Overlaps have significant probabilities, while Before is the most probable one.

Conclusion and Open Issues The two-dimensional mapping of Allenas interval relations onto parts of an hourglass configuration has been proven constructive in two ways.
First, it allowed us to decompose interval relations into two basic orthogonal dimensions: relative position and relative size of intervals.
This has motivated the definition of two primitive interval relation sets, whose probabilities are defined independently on one of the two dimensions.
Second, it simplified the probabilistic extension of Allenas relations by revealing the symmetries of relations and shedding light upon the expected behavior at the durationless and equisized limits.
To our knowledgea, this is the first attempt to assign probability values to interval relations, aiming to make reasoning with uncertain temporal relations more practical.
Both probabilistic primitive relations and probabilistic Allenas relations can be used to quantitatively describe the relation between two intervals.
However, the proposed set of probabilistic Allenas relations cannot account for relations defined by equalities (e.g.
Allenas Meets relation).
Therefore,  an open issue is to extend the current approach and define a probability base for Allenas relations defined by both inequalities and equalities.
Finally, the framework defined in this paper may be used in various ways that deviate from the event detection scenario introduced in this article.
For instance, in the context of constraint reasoning for planning and scheduling, one may be given directly the probabilities of Allen relations that hold between pairs of intervals.
The goal in this case, would be to derive information about the relative size and position of the corresponding intervals.
