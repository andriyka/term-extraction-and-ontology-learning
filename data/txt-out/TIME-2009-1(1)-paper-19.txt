The origins of mereotopology go back to the works of [9] on mereology and, on the other hand, the works of [6], [11], and [13] who used regions instead of points as the basic entity of geometry.
The mereological structures of Lesniewski are, basically, complete Boolean algebras B without a smallest element.
Whitehead's addition consists of a "connection" (or "contact") relation C among nonempty regions, which, in its simplest form is a reflexive and symmetric relation satisfying an additional extensionality axiom.
The standard model of a mereotopological structures is the set of regular closed (or regular open) sets of topological spaces hX, t i with the standard (Whiteheadian) contact among regions defined by uCv == u [?]
v 6= [?].
Timed contact algebras constitute an approach to a temporal version of a region based theory of space.
The general theory does not provide a notion of an underlying static world, i.e.
it does not explicitly contain a set of non moving regions.
Furthermore, the model of time does not have any structure, i.e.
time is neither ordered nor required to be discrete or continuous.
In this paper we want to investigate two extensions of the basic theory.
The first extension considers grounded timed contact algebras that make the underlying static world explicit.
In this context we introduce the Axiom of Construction that relates the existence of certain regions and the time structure for the first time.
The second addition is given by a betweenness relation on the set of time.
In this context we introduce the Axiom of Continuity (CONT), ensuring "smooth" movement of regions through time.
Last but not least, we show that both axioms together do not allow finite models.
The primary example is the collection of all nonempty regular closed sets of the Euclidean plane.
The simplest algebraic theory of mereotopology is given by Boolean contact algebras, which are Boolean algebras extended with a contact relation C satisfying some axioms.
They appear in different papers under various names and are closely related to the Region Connection Calculus RCC of [2], and, therefore, also the basis of relational approaches such as the relation algebra RCC8 and its extensions [4], [10].
For a recent overview of the topic we invite the reader to consult [12].
I. .
Introduction Traditionally, space has been considered using point-based theories such as geometric (e.g.
Euclidean geometry) or topological representations (point-set topology) of space.
In recent years region-based theories have been of interest in AI and, in particular, Knowledge Representation (KR).
These theories of qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR) are often based on mereotopology.
This "pointless" approach considers regions as first order elements and introduces points as second order definable entities using sets of  In [5] timed contact algebras were introduced.
They add a notion of time to Boolean contact algebras, i.e.
they constitute an adequate theory for regions moving in time.
In this approach regions are modeled by a collection of snapshots in a static world, i.e.
given a set of points in time T a moving region is just a function from T to the static world.
In other words, a region is described by a collection of static regions at any point in time t - its (spatial) extent at  Both authors gratefully acknowledge support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

However, timed contact algebras are much weaker than any theory studied in [7].
In the general theory, the set of points in time does not have any structure and the underlying static world is hidden and cannot necessarily be identified.
It is even possible that the static world differs at any point in time.
We want to demonstrate this by an example.
rest.
r2 is defined by  B((1, 0), 1 - x), 0 <= x < 1; r2 (x) = B((3, 0), 1), otherwise.
For any 0 <= x < 1 the regions r1 and r2 are in contact (they share the common point (1, 0)).
At any other point in time they are not in contact.
However, even though none of the regions disappears at any time they are never in external contact, i.e.
sharing just a boundary point.
Example 1.
In general, a region at rest, i.e.
a region that does not move (or change its shape), is modeled by a function that maps every point in time to the same static region.
In this example we want to demonstrate the static world can be different at different points in time.
In particular, there might be static regions available at some point in time that do not exist at others.
Therefore, let 2 = {0, 1} and 4 = {0, a, a* , 1} be the (finite) Boolean algebras with two and four elements, respectively.
The contact on relation on both algebras is given by overlap, i.e.
regions a and b are in contact if the have a nonzero meet or, more formally, aCb if and only if a * b 6= 0.
As model of time we choose the discrete set {0, 1}.
Now, consider all function f : {0, 1} - 2 [?]
4 with f (0) [?]
2 and f (1) [?]
4.
In this case there is no non-moving region that has a as its extent at time 1.
Finally, we want to relate both extension of the general theory.
We will show that both axioms together (CONS and CONT) do not allow finite models.
In particular, they imply that the set of points in time must be infinite.

Contact Algebras For any set X and Y [?]
X we denote by X - Y the complement of Y in X.
If X is clear from the context we simply write -Y .
For a binary relation R on D, and x [?]
D, we let R(x) = {y : xRy}, the range of x with respect to R. If ~ is an equivalence relation on a set A, we will denote the equivalence class of an element a [?]
A by [a], i.e.
[a] = {x [?]
A | a ~ x}.
In this paper we want to investigate grounded timed contact algebras that make the static world explicit.
This theory will motivate a new axiom, the Axiom of Construction (CONS), relating the existence of regions and the time structure for the first time.
A. .
Contact/Pre-Contact Relations Throughout this paper, (B, 0, 1, +, *, *) is a Boolean algebra; if no confusion can arise we sometimes denote algebras by their base set.
For details on Boolean algebras not explicitly mentioned in this paper we refer to [8].
The second addition to the general theory of timed contact algebras in this paper is given by a betweenness relation on the set of time, i.e.
we introduce some structure on time.
We are using a betweenness relation instead of some order structure because of its generality.
The structure induced by a betweenness relation includes all ordered time structures but is not restricted to those.
However, this additional structure motivates a new axiom, the Axiom of Continuity (CONT), ensuring "smooth" movement of regions through time.
To motivate this axiom we want to give an example of a region that does not move "smoothly" in the sense considered in this paper.
In the remainder we will also use difference a \ b := a * b* and the symmetric difference a4b := (a \ b) + (b \ a) of two elements a and b.
A binary relation C on a Boolean algebra B is called a contact relation (CR) if it satisfies: C0) C1) C2) C3) C4)  Example 2.
We choose the Euclidean plane as static world and the set R>=0 of the non-negative real numbers as the model of time.
We denote by B(p, r) the regular closed disc with radius r and center at point p. In this model a moving region is a function from R>=0 to the regular closed sets of the plane.
We consider two regions r1 and r2 .
r1 is the region so that r1 (x) = B((0, 0), 1) is the closed disc with radius 1 at the origin for all x [?]
R>=0 .
This region does neither move nor change its shape, i.e.
is a region at  ([?
]a)0(-C)a; ([?
]a)[a 6= 0 = aCa]; ([?]a)([?
]b)[aCb = bCa]; ([?]a)([?]b)([?
]c)[(aCb and b <= c) = aCc]; ([?]a)([?]b)([?
]c)[aC(b + c) = (aCb or aCc)].
The pair hB, Ci is called a Boolean Contact Algebra (BCA).
Axioms C0 and C1 imply that 0 is the only element with C(0) = [?
], i.e.
that is not connected to any element.
This axiom is motivated in the static world, i.e.
in contact structures without any notion of time, by the fact that we  134  B. .
Timed Contact Algebras  are not able to distinguish the empty region and a region that is not in contact to anything.
In a timed environment this might not longer be true.
A region in time might disappear, i.e.
in our interpretation it is equal to the empty region, for a certain amount of time but still be in contact to other regions for the rest of the time.
To model this we use relations that are weaker than contact relations: A relation C on a Boolean algebra B is called a pre-contact relation if it satisfies C0,C2-C4 and  A timed contact structure was first defined in [5], and is given by a set modeling time, a Boolean algebra of regions, and a family of pre-contact relations.
Definition 1: We call hT, B, (Ct )t[?
]T i a timed contact algebra if T is a non-empty set, B Boolean algebra, and Ct is a pre-contact relation on B for every t [?]
T .
The relationship aCt b denotes the fact that the regions a and b are in contact at time t.  P1) ([?]a)[([?
]b)aCb = aCa]; Any contact relation is a pre-contact relation.
Conversely, the set I := {a | C(a) = [?]}
is a Boolean ideal for every pre-contact relation.
We denote the congruence induced by I by ~C .
The following lemma was shown in [5].
Notice that the family of pre-contact relations can be seen as S a ternary relation C [?]
T x B x B defined by C = {t} x Ct .
In the remainder of the paper we will adapt t[?
]T  that view even though we will not change the notation.
Lemma 1: Let C be a pre-contact relation on a Boolean algebra B.
Then:  It is easy to verify that the set of function B T from an arbitrary set T to a Boolean (pre)-contact algebra B is a timed contact algebra.
In general, we cannot guarantee that the contact structures at each point in time are the same (or are isomorphic).
We will show below that every faithful timed contact algebra can be represented by a subdirect product.
1) I is an ideal and the relation CI on B/I defined by [a]CI [b] :== aCb is a contact relation.
2) a ~C b if and only if C(a4b) = [?].
For every t [?]
T the pre-contact relation Ct induces a congruence relation on B which we denote by ~t .
Furthermore, we denote the quotient algebra by Bt and the natural homomorphism by pt : B - Bt .
Notice that the range of C distributes over + for any (pre-) contact relation, i.e.
x [?]
C(a + b) == (a + b)Cx == aCx or bCx  We call a timed contact algebra faithful if and only if it satisfies the following:  by C2-4  == x [?]
C(a) [?]
C(b).
FAT.
([?]a)([?]b)[([?
]t)(a ~t b) = a = b].
The following property will be used later.
The next lemma provides an algebraic characterization of faithfulness:  Lemma 2: Let C be a pre-contact relation on a Boolean algebra B.
Then a ~C b implies C(a) = C(a * b) = C(b).
Lemma 3: A timed contact algebra hT, B, (Ct )t[?
]T Qi is faithful if and only if the mapping p : B - Bt  Proof: Let a ~C b.
Then C(a \ b) [?]
C(a4b) = [?
], and therefore,  t[?
]T  defined by p(b)t = pt (b), i.e.
the t-component of p(b) is pt (b), is a subdirect embedding.
C(a) = C(a * b + (a \ b))  Proof: It is well known that p is an embedding if and only if the family (pt )t[?
]T separates points (see e.g.
[1]), and the latter property is just FAT.
Since each Bt is a quotient of B, p is a subdirect embedding.
= C(a * b) [?]
C(a \ b) = C(a * b).
The property C(b) = C(a * b) is shown analogously.
As a straightforward generalization of C5 we call a timed contact algebra extensional if and only if it satisfies the following condition:  A (pre)-contact relation is called extensional if and only if it satisfies the following axiom: C5) ([?]a)([?
]b)[C(a) = C(b) = a = b].
EXT.
([?]a)([?]b)[([?
]t)(Ct (a) = Ct (b)) = a = b].
Notice that an extensional pre-contact relation is already a contact relation.
From Lemma 2 we immediately conclude that every extensional timed contact algebra is also faithful.
135  C. .
Topological models  theory need not to be functions we cannot immediately transfer this idea.
Our approach will be based on a binary relation and maximal cliques thereof.
First we recall some notions from topology.
By a topological space (X, t ) we mean a set X provided with a family t of subsets, called open sets, which contains the empty set and the whole set X, and is closed with respect to arbitrary unions and finite intersections.
A subset a [?]
X is called closed if it is the complement of an open set.
We say that a region a is at rest with respect to a region b (or a and b are at rest or a is not moving with respect to b), denoted by aRb, if and only if ([?
]t)(aCt b) = ([?
]t)(aCt b).
Definition 2: Let hT, B, (Ct )t[?
]T i be a timed contact structure.
A subalgebra S of B is called static if and only if the elements of S are pairwise at rest, i.e.
aRb for all a, b [?]
S.  In every topological space one can define the following operations on subsets a [?]
X: S 1) Int(a) = {o [?]
t | o [?]
a} (the interior of a), i.e., the unionTof all open sets contained in a.
2) Cl(a) = {c is closed | a [?]
c} (the closure of a), i.e., the intersection of all closed sets containing a.  Lemma 4: Each timed contact structure hT, B, (Ct )t[?
]T i permits a non-empty and maximal static subalgebra.
Proof: First, it is easy to verify that the subalgebra {0, 1} is indeed static because 0(-Ct )1 for any t [?]
T .
The existence of a maximal subalgebra now follows from Zorn'sSLemma: In order to apply that lemma we show that S= Si of a chain (Si )i[?
]I (with respect to inclusion) of  Cl and Int are interdefinable, i.e.
Cl(a) = -Int(-a) and Int(a) = -Cl(-a).
A subset a of X is called regular closed if Cl(Int(a)) = a.
We denote by RC(X) the family of regular closed sets of X.
It is a well known fact that RC(X) is a Boolean algebra with respect to the following operations and constants:  i[?
]I  static subalgebras is again a static subalgebra.
It is easy to verify that S is a subalgebra of B.
Now, assume a, b [?]
S and that there is a t [?]
T with aCt b.
Then there is a j [?]
I with a, b [?]
Sj since (Si )i[?
]I is a chain.
From the fact that Sj is a static subalgebra of B we conclude aCt b for all t [?]
T.  0 = [?
], 1 = X, a + b = a [?]
b and a * b = Cl(Int(a [?]
b)).
RC(X) naturally provides a contact relation C defined by aCb if and only if a [?]
b 6= [?].
C is called the standard (or Whiteheadian) contact relation on RC(X).
Maximal static subalgebras are usually not unique.
Furthermore, such a maximal static subalgebra might not be rich enough to characterize the extent of every region at any point in time.
To illustrate this, consider Example 1 again.
The set of constant functions, i.e.
the functions 0(x) = 0 and 1(x) = 1, is the universe of a maximal static subalgebra, but none of those functions satisfies f (1) = a.
We regard a region in time as a function f : T - RC(X), i.e.
the function providing the spatial extent of the region for every point in time.
We denote the set of all such function by XT and define Ct [?]
XT x XT by  Definition 3: Let hT, B, (Ct )t[?
]T i be a timed contact structure.
A maximal static subalgebra S is called a basis of regions at rest (or simply basis) if and only if for all b [?]
B and all t [?]
T there is a [?]
S with b ~t a.
In this situation the structure hT, B, (Ct )t[?
]T , Si is called a grounded (timed) contact algebra.
f Ct g : == f (t) [?]
g(t) 6= [?].
Notice that for each t [?]
T the relation Ct is defined by the standard contact relation on B, i.e.
f Ct g if and only if f (t)C w g(t).
Since elements of a basis are pairwise at rest, the restriction of any of the relations Ct to S yields the same relation.
We will denote this relation by CS , i.e.
for all a, b [?]
S we have  The following theorem was shown in [5].
Theorem 1: Let hT, B, (Ct )t[?
]T i be a timed contact structure.
Then there is a compact and semi-regular T0 space hX, t i and an embedding k : B - XT with aCt b if and only if k(a)(t) [?]
k(b)(t) 6= [?].
aCS b == ([?

]T , Si be a grounded contact algebra.
Then hS, CS i is  III.
.
Basis of Regions At Rest  1) a BCA if B is faithful, 2) an extensional BCA if B is extensional.
In a concrete topological model we may call the constant functions regions at rest since they neither move nor change their shape.
Since the elements in the abstract  Proof: 1) It is sufficient to show the ideal I = {a [?]
S | CS (a) = [?]}
just contains 0.
Assume there is a 6= 0  136  with CS (a) = [?].
We want to show that Ct (a) = [?]
for all t [?]
T since this implies a ~t 0 for all t [?]
T , and, hence, a = 0 using FAT, a contradiction.
Therefore, assume that there is a c [?]
B and a t [?]
T with aCt c. Then there is an element b [?]
S with b ~t c because S is a basis.
We obtain a [?]
Ct (c) = Ct (b) by Lemma 2, and, hence, aCS b, a contradiction.
following axiom of construction ensures the existence of such a region: CONS.
([?]a)([?]b)([?
]t1 )([?
]t2 )[t1 6= t2 = ([?
]c)(c ~t1 a and c ~t2 b)].
Even though the Axiom of Construction is motivated by regions at rest, the axiom does not require the existence of a basis.
2) Since extensionality implies injectivity S is a BCA by 1.
Now, assume CS (a) = CS (b) for a, b [?]
S. We want to show that Ct (a) = Ct (b) for all t [?]
T since this implies a = b by EXT.
Therefore, assume aCt c. Then there is a d [?]
S with c ~t d since S is a basis.
We get a [?]
Ct (c) = Ct (d), i.e.
aCt d. From d [?]
S we conclude aCS d, and, hence, d [?]
CS (a) = CS (b).
This immediately implies b [?]
Ct (d) = Ct (c), i.e.
bCt c.  V.. Betweenness Relation Betweenness relations were studied in detail in [3].
A ternary relation Btw on a set U is called a betweenness relation if it satisfies BT0) ([?
]a) Btw(a, a, a); BT1) ([?]a)([?]b)([?
]c)[Btw(a, b, c) = Btw(c, b, a)];  In the next theorem we want to establish that a basis really captures regions at rest, i.e.
that the elements in S can be regarded as constant functions.
BT2) ([?]a)([?]b)([?
]c)[Btw(a, b, c) = Btw(a, a, b)]; BT3) ([?]a)([?]b)([?
]c)[(Btw(a, b, c) and Btw(a, c, b)) = b = c].
Theorem 3: Let hT, B, (Ct )t[?
]T , Si be a faithful grounded contact algebra.
Then B can be embedded into the algebra of functions S T .
Furthermore, the basis S corresponds to the set of constant functions in S T .
Every partial order on a set induces a betweenness relation on that set but not necessarily vice versa.
It was shown in [3] that a betweenness relation is generated by a partial order if and only if it satisfies the additional axioms:  Proof: By Theorem 2 we know that S together with CS is a BCA.
We want to show that c ~t a and c ~t b for a t [?]
T with a, b [?]
S implies a = b, i.e.
that the mapping ht : B - S defined by ht (c) = a if and only if c ~t a and a [?]
S is well defined.
Since ~t is an equivalence relation we obtain a ~t b.
From a ~t b is equivalent to C(a4b) = [?]
and a, b [?]
S we get a ~t b for all t [?]
T .
Injectivity implies a = b.
Now, define h(c)(t) := ht (c), and we have to show that cCt d if and only if ht (c)CS ht (d).
This follows immediately from Ct (ht (c)) = Ct (c) 3 d and c [?]
Ct (d) = Ct (ht (d)).
BT4) There are no odd cycles in the graph of the relation Btw(a, a, b); BT5) ([?]a)([?]b)([?
]c)[(Btw(a, b, c) and Btw(b, c, d) and b 6= c) = Btw(a, b, d)].
Notice that BT4 can neither be expressed by a finite set of first-order axioms nor by using a finite number of variables.
Axiom BT5 is also called "outer transitivity axiom".
We call a betweenness relation Btw on U dense if and only if for all u1 , u2 [?]
U with u1 6= u2 there is a u [?]
U with u 6= u1 , u 6= u2 and Btw(u1 , u, u2 ).
It remains to show that h maps the elements of S to constant functions.
Since ~t is reflexive we have a ~t a, and, hence, ht (a) = a for all t [?]
T .
Therefore, h(a)(t) = a for all a [?]
S. Notice that the previous theorem can also be stated in terms of a subdirect product.
It shows that in the current case all components of the product Bt are isomorphic to S.  As already mentioned in the introduction we want to stay as general as possible.
Therefore, we are going to use the more general concept of betweenness on the set of time instead of a partial order.
IV.. Axiom of Construction  Definition 4: Let hT, B, (Ct )t[?
]T i be a timed contact structure, and Btw be a betweenness relation on T .
Then hT, Btw, B, (Ct )t[?
]T i is called a BLT-algebra.
We are interested in ensuring the existence of a moving region if two snapshots are provided.
This is of particular interest if we have a notion of static regions, i.e.
a grounded contact structure.
Assume one fixes two points in time, and for both points a static region.
Is there a region that moves through those static regions at those points in time?
The  VI.. Axiom of Continuity In order to state the axiom we need two more predicates.

Furthermore, we are interested in timed version of external contact.
In the static world external contact aECb can be defined by aCb and a * b = 0.
Using the relation ~t we define external contact at t by  In this paper we started to investigate axioms that relate the existence of regions and the temporal structure of timed contact algebras.

Example 2 shows that not every BLT-algebra satisfies CONT.
However, we obtain the following relationship between the temporal structure and the Axiom of Construction: Lemma 5: Let hT, Btw, B, (Ct )t[?
]T , Si be an extensional grounded BLT algebra satisfying CONT, CONS and |S| > 2.
Then Btw is dense.
Proof: Since |S| > 2 there is an element a [?]
S with a 6= 0, 1.
By Theorem 2 hS, CS i is an extensional BCA, i.e.
there is b [?]
S with b 6= 0 and a(-CS )b.
From a 6= 0 we conclude that CS (a) 6= [?]
using the extensionality of CS .
This is equivalent to aCt a for all t [?]
T .
The property bCt b for all t [?]
T follows analogously.
Now, assume t1 , t2 [?]
T with t1 6= t2 .
CONS implies that there is a region c [?]
B with c ~t1 a and c ~t2 b.
We distinguish two cases: -N Z(t1 , t2 , c): In this case there is a t [?]
T with Btw(t1 , t, t2 ) and c ~t 0, i.e.
c(-Ct )c. From a ~t1 c and aCt1 a we conclude cCt1 a.
This implies c 6~t1 0, and, hence, t 6= t1 .
The property t 6= t2 is shown analogously using c ~t2 b and bCt2 b. N Z(t1 , t2 , c): Since aCt a for all t [?]
T we get N Z(t1 , t2 , a).
Furthermore, we have a [?]
Ct1 (a) = Ct1 (c), i.e.
aCt1 c, and a 6[?]
Ct2 (b) = Ct2 (c), i.e.
a(-Ct2 )c. From CONT we conclude that there is a t [?]
T with Btw(t1 , t, t2 ) and aECt c. Since a [?]
Ct1 (a) = Ct1 (a * c) we get a(-ECt1 )c. This verifies t 6= t1 .
Since a(-Ct2 )b and c ~t2 b we have a(-Ct2 )c. This shows t 6= t2 .
